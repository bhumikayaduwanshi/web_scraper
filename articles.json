Expatiating further, the learned counsel relied on the observation of a Full Bench of the Calcutta High Court in Subhas Yadav v. State of West Bengal3, and it is urged that the request for extension of the period of detention must be on the basis of the report of the Public Prosecutor which must record the progress of the investigation and spell out specific reasons to justify further detention beyond 180 days. This requirement has not been complied with, contends the learned counsel.Drafted By Abhijit Mishra", "[Landmark Judgement]\u00a0Sudesh Kumar Goyal V.

Manral, addressed an appeal challenging the judgment and order issued by the District Commission in a consumer complaint case, where the complainant was granted relief.In this Case, the complainant had lodged a complaint to claim the insured amount from the insurance company (opposite party No. 1). According to the complaint, the complainant\u2019s insured house suffered severe damage due to flooding, with the lobby and veranda floors collapsing, resulting in a loss of Rs. 1,50,000/- for the complainant.Immediate notification of this loss was provided to the insurance company, and the insurance company dispatched a surveyor to inspect the insured property and capture photographs of the damaged areas.The insurance company, based on the surveyor\u2019s observations, rejected the claim and informed the claimant. This repudiation of the claim constituted a deficiency in service, leading the complainant to file the complaint.Counsel for the appellant argued that only the soil in the floor had subsided due to improper compaction during construction, resulting in subsidence at a single location due to negligent construction.The court observed that the insurance company had erroneously repudiated the claim of respondent No. 1, citing a disparity between the description of the insured property and the property where the alleged loss occurred.The bench noted that the insured property\u2019s description was correctly provided as Majri Mafi, Mohakampur, Dehradun in the proposal form. However, the insurance company had recorded the incorrect address of the insured property in the insurance policy coverage note.The court concluded that the insurance company had rejected the claim on incorrect grounds, constituting a deficiency in service. Therefore, the District Commission\u2019s contested judgment was proper and justified, with no legal or factual flaws in its findings.Consequently, the bench dismissed the appeal.Case Title: National Insurance Company Ltd. v.

In a court order, it was emphasized that as constitutional courts, they couldn\u2019t ignore the serious abuse of law in this case and had a duty to rectify the wrong.The case came to light when the music teacher\u2019s wife sought his release through a habeas corpus petition, represented by advocates Kripashankar Pandey and Darshan Juikar. The teacher informed the court that not only did the policemen use verbal abuse, but he was also subjected to humiliation, including being stripped naked while in custody.The incident began when a 23-year-old woman, who was a student of the music teacher, filed a First Information Report (FIR) against him. The FIR, registered at Tardeo police station, accused the teacher of offenses punishable under sections 354(A) (sexual harassment) and 509 (insulting a woman\u2019s modesty) of the Indian Penal Code. The allegation centered on the teacher allegedly asking the student to watch a web series on an Over-The-Top (OTT) platform.Despite the charges being bailable in nature, the music teacher was detained on July 17 and placed in a lock-up after a medical examination.During extensive hearings, senior police officers issued an unconditional apology, but the bench of Justices Revati Mohite-Dere and Gauri Godse strongly criticized the actions of the police officers involved.The court has ordered the compensation to be deposited before November 10.Additionally, the Mumbai Police Commissioner has been instructed to appoint an Officer not below the rank of Deputy Commissioner of Police to conduct an inquiry into the conduct of the police officers at Tardeo Police Station and the Saat Rasta Lock-up. The music teacher and his wife will have the opportunity to present their side during the inquiry, which must be completed by November 24.In addition to the compensation, the court has ruled that the amount should be recovered from the salary of those found responsible for the illegal detention and actions within the lock-up after a thorough inquiry.The court has also instructed the Director General of Police, State of Maharashtra, and the Commissioner of Police, Mumbai, to issue appropriate guidelines and directions to police stations regarding bail in bailable offenses, based on the judgment and order.", "Consumer Court Levies Rs 20,000 Fine on Flipkart for Order Cancellation": "LI NetworkPublished on: 01 October 2023 at 15:45 ISTIn a significant legal decision, a consumer court in Berhampur, Odisha, has imposed a fine of Rs 20,000 on the leading e-commerce giant, Flipkart, for canceling a customer\u2019s order, with the penalty amount directed to be paid to the aggrieved customer.After a protracted legal battle, Gandhi Behera emerged victorious against Flipkart, finally finding relief after a year of relentless pursuit of justice. Flipkart swiftly issued him a cheque for Rs 20,000 in accordance with the court\u2019s judgment.According to the complaint, Gandhi came across a pair of shoes on Flipkart\u2019s platform while browsing. Originally priced at Rs 4,999, the shoes were available at a discounted rate of Rs 975. Without hesitation, Gandhi placed an online order for the shoes and eagerly anticipated their delivery.However, his excitement quickly turned into disappointment when he learned that Flipkart had canceled his order the following day. A disheartened Gandhi attempted to contact the company\u2019s helpline to voice his grievances but faced rejection. No one was willing to listen to his complaints regarding the sudden order cancellation.Growing increasingly frustrated with his attempts to resolve the matter, Gandhi sought assistance from the National Consumer helpline. They advised him to file a complaint with the local consumer court. Following this guidance, Gandhi approached the Ganjam District Consumer Court and lodged a formal complaint against Flipkart.In his complaint, he accused Flipkart of promoting deceptive offers to lure customers, canceling orders without obtaining customer consent, and causing him mental distress. After a thorough examination of the case, the district court recognized and upheld Gandhi\u2019s rights as a consumer, resulting in a Rs 20,000 penalty being imposed on Flipkart.In compliance with the court\u2019s directives, Flipkart expeditiously provided Gandhi with a Rs 20,000 cheque, as reported.Also Read: Notable Cases: When Consumer Courts Awarded Extraordinary Damages", "SURYA PRATAP SHAHI": "Cabinet Minister of Uttar PradeshSurya Pratap Shahi is an Indian politician belonging to Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

The society provides technical and hand-holding support to non-governmental organization as also to governmental and multilateral bodies in several States in India. It has also been involved in legal intervention , research and training on the issue concerning children and their rights. The society has filed a petition under article 32 of the Constitution in public interest with a view to draw attention to the violation to the rights of girls who are married between ages 15 and 18 years.As per section 375 of the I.P.C. prescribes the age of consent for sexual intercourse as 18 years meaning thereby that any person having sexual intercourse with a girl child below 18 years of age would be statutorily guilty of rape even if the sexual activity was with her consent and for this reason the law penalizes sexual intercourse with a girl who is below 18 years of age. Unfortunately, by virtue of Exception 2 to section 375 of the I.P.C., if a girl child between 15 and 18 years of age is married, her husband can have non-consensual sexual intercourse with her, without being penalized under the I.P.C., only because she is married to him and for no other reason.Issue-In the sec.375 Exception (2) of I.P.C. it is written that \u201c Sexual intercourse or sexual act by a man with his own wife, the wife not being under 15 years of age is not rape \u201d but the other pro-child acts and human rights act state the otherwise.Contentions of Parties-Petitioner-Respondent-Judgement-The division bench of the Apex Court consisting Justice Madan B. Lokur and Justice Deepak Gupta passed a concurring and well written judgement by harmonizing the system of laws relating to children and require Exception 2 to section 375 of the I.P.C. to now meaningfully read as ; \u201cSexual intercourse or sexual acts by a man with his own wife, the wife not being under eighteen years of age, is not rape\u201d.It is only through this reading that the intent of social justice to the married girl child and the constitutional vision of the farmers of our constitution can be preserved and protected and perhaps given impetus.Rule of law-The sec. 375 of I.P.C deals with rape which has two exception the second exception being \u201c sexual intercourse of sexual acts by a man with his own wife, the wife not being under 15 years of age is not rape\u201d however this aforementioned section conflict with the POSCO Act, an act which was solely passed to protect the children from as such thing but the POSCO Act, being a special law has a provision in case where one or more laws are involved the special law will prevail above them.Comment-The bench \u00a0addressed all the issues regarding this case and viewed all the documents and report and also gave thought about the current requirements of the society and delivered a judgement which is prospective and in the good side of the law but it will help the society to eradicate the concept of child marriage and rape.Conclusion-The only pragmatic option available was to harmonize the system of laws relating to children and read Exception 2 of Section 375 of the IPC in a purposive manner to make it in consonance with the POSCO Act, the spirit of other pro-child legislation and the human rights of a married girl child.", "Google LLC facing a $5 billion lawsuit over tracking user data in incognito mode.": "By Bhavesh Singh-Google LLC one of the big four\u2019s is facing a probable class action lawsuit for tracking user and collecting data and other web activity.

It is used in bankruptcy processes. When it comes to dividing up the debtor\u2019s assets, this system is intended to ensure that the procedure is just, understandable, and foreseeable.Its aim is to ensure that everyone involved in the process receives fair treatment and that the assets are allocated in a way that maximises fairness for everyone. The waterfall mechanism, along with its main components and historical development, will be covered in this article.The central goals and components of the waterfall mechanism encompass:Priority of Dues under Section 53 of IBCSection 53 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC), plays a pivotal role in defining the precise order of priority for asset distribution during insolvency proceedings in India. This section categorizes the various types of creditors and stakeholders and specifies the sequence in which they are eligible to receive payments. The priorities laid out in Section 53 are fundamental in maintaining equity and consistency within insolvency proceedings.Key elements of Section 53 of the IBC include:The waterfall mechanism, as outlined in Section 53 of the IBC, serves as the fundamental structure of insolvency proceedings in India. It lays out a precise hierarchy of priorities, ensuring equitable treatment for various stakeholders and guaranteeing an organized and fair distribution of assets. This mechanism is pivotal in upholding confidence in the insolvency process and facilitating the resolution of financial distress in a just and efficient manner.\u00a0\u2018Waterfall mechanism\u2019 under IBC: Key provisions and RulingsSection 53 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC) establishes a hierarchy for the settlement of debts. Whether it\u2019s the distribution of assets during the liquidation process or the implementation of a resolution plan, both procedures are required to respect the prioritization outlined in Section 53 of the IBCIn the case of PR Commissioner of Income Tax v. Monnet Ispat and Energy Limited, the Supreme Court ruled that income tax dues, considered as crown debt, do not take precedence over secured creditors who are private individuals. Similarly, in the case of Moser Baer Karamchari Union thr. President Mahesh Chand Sharma v. Union of India & Ors, the Supreme Court stressed the importance of priority payments under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). It emphasized that the IBC provisions are well-considered and provide options to secured creditors while balancing their interests with other creditors in liquidation proceedings.Similarly, in the case of Sundaresh Bhatt, Liquidator of ABG Shipyard v. Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs, it was established that the IBC takes precedence over proceedings under the Customs Act. This means that authorities cannot enforce taxes and levies under the Customs Act once the moratorium period begins.However, there was a shift in this position due to the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment in the State tax officer v. Rainbow Papers Ltd In this ruling, contrary to its previous decisions, the Supreme Court emphasized the non-obstante clause of the Gujarat Value Added Tax (GVAT) Act. It held that a \u201csecurity interest\u201d under the IBC can also be established by operation of law and a statute, granting government authorities the status of secured creditors. This decision led to confusion in the IBC regime, as state tax departments started filing claims anew in ongoing liquidation proceedings, seeking equal treatment with first-priority secured creditors.The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) expressed concerns about this situation on a January 18, 2023 discussion paper. In an effort to clarify the treatment of security interests created by statutes, the MCA proposed amendments to the Code. While the MCA\u2019s proposal was pending, the Supreme Court\u2019s recent judgment in the matter has cleared the uncertainty created by the Rainbow Papers ruling. It once again affirmed the overriding effect of the IBC in insolvency proceedings.Landmark RulingPaschimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Ltd. v. Raman Ispat Private LimitedIn the Paschimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Ltd. v. Raman Ispat Private Limited case, a significant legal precedent was established in the context of insolvency and debt repayment in India. The case revolved around Raman Ispat Pvt. Ltd., a corporate debtor that had an electricity supply agreement with PVVNL. According to this agreement, any outstanding dues would be treated as a charge on the assets of the corporate debtor, as per the provisions of the Electricity Act, 2003, and related regulations. When Raman Ispat failed to clear its electricity dues, PVVNL attached the corporate debtor\u2019s properties under the District Collector\u2019s orders. Subsequently, Raman Ispat went into liquidation, and the liquidator argued that PVVNL\u2019s claim should be classified according to Section 53 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC), which determines the priority of debt repayment.The PVVNL case holds significant relevance for several reasons such as:Clarity on Priority: The case provided much-needed clarity on the priority of debt repayment in insolvency cases, particularly concerning government dues versus private creditors\u2019 claims.Section 238 of the IBC: The Supreme Court, in this case, upheld that Section 238 of the IBC takes precedence over the Electricity Act. It clarified that debts owed to creditors under the IBC have a higher priority than electricity dues payable under the Electricity Act.Private Creditor Emphasis: The judgment emphasized the importance of honoring private financial commitments within the insolvency regime. It signaled a shift in the precedence of repayment obligations, favoring unsecured creditors over government dues.State Tax Officer v. Rainbow Papers Ltd Ruling Prior to the PVVNL case, the State Tax Officer v. Rainbow Papers Ltd. case set a different precedent. In Rainbow Papers, the Supreme Court ruled that when a security interest is established in favour of the government for tax claims under the Gujarat Value Added Tax Act, 2003, the government assumes the role of a secured creditor within the context of the IBC. This ruling stated that any resolution plan omitting payment of such taxes or statutory dues owed to the government would not align with the provisions of the IBC and would not be legally binding on the State.Precedence of Rainbow Papers:The Rainbow Papers ruling, until the PVVNL case, held precedence, and it regarded government claims, particularly tax claims, as secured creditor claims under the IBC.How PVVNL Overruled the Rainbow Papers Case:In the PVVNL case, the Supreme Court effectively overruled the Rainbow Papers case through its judgment and the following key observations:In essence, the PVVNL case has effectively reset the legal precedent, favouring private creditors\u2019 rights and establishing a clear hierarchy in debt repayment, overriding the previous ruling in the Rainbow Papers case. It ensures that creditors under the IBC, both secured and unsecured, hold precedence over government obligations when resolving insolvency matters, marking a significant shift in the interpretation of the law.ConclusionThe overriding of the Rainbow Papers ruling by the Paschimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Ltd. v. Raman Ispat Private Limited case represents a crucial correction in the interpretation of insolvency and debt repayment laws in India. The PVVNL case rightly re-established the order of priority, emphasizing the supremacy of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) in governing insolvency proceedings. It clarified that government dues, while important, should not take precedence over the rights of private creditors, ensuring a fair and equitable distribution of assets. This decision brings clarity and consistency to the insolvency process, upholding the principles of fairness and transparency that underlie the waterfall mechanism outlined in Section 53 of the IBC", "The Vital Role of MOA in Legal Compliance, A Guide for Entrepreneurs": "By Adv.

This limitation is important as it protects shareholders and stakeholders from risks associated with activities that were not initially intended or agreed upon.Shareholders invest in a company based on its stated objectives in the MOA. If the company ventures beyond these objectives without proper shareholder approval, it could lead to legal complications. The MOA ensures that shareholders are aware of the company\u2019s intended activities and protects their interests.The MOA serves as a source of authority for the company\u2019s actions. It dictates what the company can and cannot do. Decisions and actions taken by the company must align with the provisions in the MOA. It is a fundamental document in legal proceedings related to the company\u2019s activities.Investors often scrutinize the MOA before investing in a company. A clearly defined and well-structured MOA instills confidence in potential investors, as it provides transparency regarding the company\u2019s goals and objectives.The MOA guides the company\u2019s decision-making processes. It acts as a reference point for the board of directors and executives when making strategic decisions. It ensures that the company\u2019s actions are in line with its intended purpose.Any changes to the MOA require approval from the shareholders. This ensures that significant alterations in the company\u2019s objectives or structure are made with the consent of the owners, safeguarding their interestsPurpose of MOAThe purpose of memorandum is two-fold, the intending shareholder who contemplates the investment of his savings, should know the field in, or the purpose for which it is going to be used and what risk he is taking in making the investment. The second purpose is that anyone dealing with the company will know without reasonable doubt whether the contractual relation into which the contemplates entering with the company is one relating to a mater within its corporate objects.Why MOA needs to be registered?Registering the Memorandum of Association (MOA) is a crucial step in the process of incorporating a company. To bring the MOA into legal bunding force, it needs to be subscribed by its members. The Key/founding members of the company are the ones that initially subscribe to the MOA. Section 3 of the Act states that a company can be formed when the statutory requirement of the requisite company is signed by their specified no. of members i.e :A copy of the MOA after duly being signed is then submitted with the responding ROC. ROC then provides a certified copy of the MOA to the public upon payment of the prescribed fees.Format of MOAThese are the key elements or clauses that MUST be included in the MOA. The memorandum of a company shall be in respective forms specified in Tables A, B, C, D and E in Schedule I as may be applicable to such company. Section 4(6) talks about the forms that need to be filled as1) Table A \u2013Companies limited by shares2) Table B \u2013 Companies limited by guarantee not having a share capital3) Table C \u2013 Companies limited by guarantee having a share capital4) Table D \u2013 Unlimited companies not having a share capital5) Table E \u2013 Unlimited companies having a share capitalDrafting MOAThe vital parts of an MOA are Name Clause, Registered Office Clause, Liability Clause, Capital Clause and Association Clause. Before Drafting an MOA, the members need to be clear about the objectives of the company and the scope of its activities. Further there should be an Articles of Association (AOA) complimenting the MOA, that takes care of the internal details of company\u2019s governing aspect.In short, the memorandum enables shareholders, creditors and all those who deal with the company to know what its powers are and what the range of its activities is.Essential Clauses of MOAThere are 6 essential clauses in MOA, which is as following: Name ClauseThis defines the type of ownership of the company. A public company ends with \u201cLimited\u201d. A private company has to end with \u201cPrivate Limited\u201d. Government companies don\u2019t need to use either of the two. Section 8 companies are an exception to this rule, they don\u2019t have any special identifying requirement as per naming clause is concerned.Registered Office ClauseThe name of the State in which the registered office of the company is to be situated must be given in the memorandum. But the exact address of the registered office is not required to be stated therein.As per Section 12, a company shall, within 30 days of its incorporation, shall have a registered office. The company shall furnish to the Registrar verification of its registered office within a period of 30 days of its incorporationObject ClauseThis clause determines the purpose and capacity of the company. It indicates the purpose for which the company has been set up and its actual capability, besides its sphere of activities.The object clause of memorandum shall state \u201cthe objects for which the company is proposed to be incorporated and any matter considered necessary in furtherance thereof.The subscribers to the memorandum of association enjoy almost unrestricted freedom to choose the objects. The only restriction is that objects should not be illegal and against the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013.Liability ClauseEvery company must state whether the liability of its members is limited by shares or limited by guarantee or is unlimited.In a company limited by shares, no member can be called upon be to pay more than what remains unpaid. If his shares are fully paid-up, his liability is nil.In a company limited by guarantee, the liability clause will state the amount, which each member should undertake to contribute to the assets of the company in the event of liquidation of the company. He cannot be called upon to pay anything before the company goes into liquidation.In an unlimited company, the clause shall specify that the liability of members is unlimited and can extend to personal assets of the members.Capital ClauseThis clause must state the amount of the capital with which the company is registered. The shares into which the capital is divided must be of fixed value, which is commonly known as the nominal value of the share. The capital is variously described as \u201cnominal\u201d, authorized\u201d or registered\u201dAssociate ClauseIn this clause, the person (includes a body corporate) subscribing to the memorandum declare their desire to be formed into a company and agree to take the shares indicated opposite their respective names.Following are the statutory requirements regarding subscription of memorandum:-(i) The memorandum must be signed by each subscriber in the presence of at least one witness who must attest the signatures;(ii) Each subscriber must take at least one share; if any and(iii) Each subscriber must write opposite his name the number of shares (if any) which the agrees to take.Any action taken by the company that is outside the scope of activities mentioned in the MOA is considered ultra vires (beyond the powers) and therefore, void and illegal. However, many jurisdictions have significantly reduced the doctrine of ultra vires, allowing companies to engage in activities that are reasonably necessary to achieve their stated objectives.Alteration of MOAAny changes to be made in the MOA can be changed by a special resolution, or a government approved mandate notifying ROC. Where a company changes its name or obtains a new name, it shall within a period of fifteen days from the date of such change, give notice of the change to the Registrar along with the order of the Central Government, who shall carry out necessary changes in the certificate of incorporation and the memorandum. Any material/minute changes have to be approved by the board then government or ROC.Rectification of Name (Sec. 16):This section empowers the Central Government (Power delegated to Regional Director) to give directions to the company to rectify its name if in its opinion, the name registered is identical with or too nearly resembles the name, by which a company in existence has been previously registered. The company shall change its name within a period of three months, from the issue of such directions after passing an ordinary resolution.Further also, on an application made to the Central Government by the registered proprietor of a trade mark that the name is identical with or too nearly resembles to an existing trade mark, the Central Government may direct the company to change its name. The company shall change its name within a period of six months from the issue of such directions after passing an ordinary resolution. A registered trade mark owner has to file an application to the Central Government for rectification of name which is similar to name of its trade mark within 3 years of incorporation of company or change of name.Change of Registered Office (Sec. 12)Section 12 provides that a company shall, within 30 days of its incorporation, shall have a registered office. The company shall furnish to the Registrar verification of its registered office within a period of 30 days of its incorporation in Form INC.22.Every company is required to affix or paint its name and the address of the registered office in any of the language in general use in the locality where the company\u2019s registered office is situated, besides any other language if the company chooses to have it painted or affixed in such other language. Name and address are to be affixed and painted outside every office or place in which business is carried on at a conspicuous position.ConclusionMOA is a constitution of a Company; it is the foundation on which the structure of the company is built. As the Constitution of India can be amended, the same applies to MOA as well. Over time, there will be a need for amendments in MOA, which is allowed with a set of compliances that need to be taken care of while alteration. Alterations have a lot of compliances attached to it so as to protect the shareholders and investors from getting defrauded. Companies Act, 2013 makes it compulsory for every company to have its own articles and file the same with ROC for registration.References", "What is Cross-Border Insolvency: An Overview": "By Tanushree DubeyPublished on: 28 September 2023 at 10:30 ISTThe contemporary world that is characterized by the rapid proliferation of technology, globalization, and the expansive reach of corporate entities, the traditional demarcations separating nations and businesses have emerged significantly. Practically every nation now engages in cross-border trade, leading to intricate insolvency processes that is complicated by the interplay of diverse legal systems.The harmonization of domestic laws with international insolvency regulations remains an ongoing challenge, raising questions about the extent to which domestic and foreign insolvency laws align.In this article, we will delve into the concept of cross-border insolvency, while exploring the pertinent legal framework in India, the UNCITRAL Model Law, and consider the limitations of cross border Insolvency.Understanding Cross-Border InsolvencyCross-border insolvency, often referred to as international insolvency, arises when an insolvent debtor finds itself with creditors and debtors dispersed across multiple jurisdictions, often spanning in different countries. Within domestic insolvency proceedings, several key phases are typically followed, including the identification of the debtor\u2019s assets, the assessment of creditor claims, and the eventual settlement of these claims, all subject to approval by the relevant Adjudicatory Authority.In India, the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC) stands as the principal legislation governing insolvency and bankruptcy matters. However, despite notable progress in streamlining insolvency processes within India, the IBC lacks comprehensive provisions for the regulation of cross-border insolvency proceedings. Acknowledging this gap, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) formed the Insolvency Law Committee on Cross-Border Insolvency (ILC) to evaluate the implementation of the IBC.Legal Framework for Cross-Border Insolvency in IndiaCross-border insolvency primarily revolves around the regulation of insolvency proceedings that transcend domestic jurisdiction. Key facets of cross-border insolvency encompass:Relevant provisions under IBCThe IBC furnishes two provisions, namely Section 234 and Section 235, which are intended to address cross-border insolvency matters:However, bilateral agreements often prove to be time-consuming, costly, and inconclusive, largely due to the intricacies of negotiation. While these provisions provide some guidance on cross-border insolvency in India, they fall short of providing a comprehensive framework, a limitation acknowledged by the ILC in its report of 2018.UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency, 1997The UNCITRAL Model Law offers legislative guidance for managing cross-border insolvency cases. It is widely endorsed for its potential to provide holistic solutions for cross-border insolvency challenges. International institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) advocate for the adoption of the Model Law to enhance cooperation and coordination among courts and authorities in various jurisdictions.The Model Law is underpinned by four fundamental principles:Draft Part Z: Tackling Cross-Border Insolvency in IndiaIn response to the limitations of the existing cross-border insolvency mechanism in India, a set of draft guidelines was introduced to address this issue. A specific chapter within these guidelines, Part Z, aims to provide a framework for managing cross-border insolvency. These guidelines, recommended by the ILC in 2018, draw inspiration from the UNCITRAL Model Law.Key Highlights of the Draft Chapter:Limitations of Cross-Border Insolvency in IndiaCase LawsIn Jet Airways V. State bank of India, Jet Airways became the first Indian company embroiled in a cross-border insolvency case in India in the year 2019. The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) set a precedent by initiating a Joint Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process, exemplifying the complexities inherent in cross-border insolvency disputes. Simultaneously, insolvency proceedings were launched against Jet Airways in a Dutch court, where a bankruptcy administrator was appointed to oversee assets located in the Netherlands. Initially, due to the absence of effective cross-border insolvency provisions, the NCLT refused to stay Indian insolvency proceedings or recognize the Dutch proceedings. However, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) subsequently overturned the NCLT\u2019s decision, directing cooperation between the Bankruptcy Administrator and Resolution Professional. This cooperation was guided by principles akin to those found in the Model Law.In State Bank of India V. Videocon Industries Ltd. the Mumbai Bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) made a ground-breaking decision, allowing the consolidation of 13 out of 15 companies within the Videocon Group for insolvency proceedings. This marked the first instance of group consolidation for insolvency under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), aiming to maximize asset value and setting a precedent for group insolvency cases. The doctrine of \u201csubstantial consolidation\u201d empowers the NCLT to merge assets and liabilities of individual corporate entities for a unified insolvency resolution process, ensuring fair value for stressed group assets and protecting creditors\u2019 interests. In the absence of specific IBC provisions, the NCLT invoked principles from US and UK bankruptcy jurisprudence, ruling in favor of consolidation. In February 2020, NCLT extended group insolvency to include four foreign-based companies, raising questions about extraterritorial IBC application and asset amalgamation processes. This case highlighted coordination challenges in cross-border insolvency and emphasized the need for legislative frameworks to govern such situations.The first-ever recognition of Indian insolvency proceedings under Chapter 15 of the US Bankruptcy Code signifies an important development. Chapter 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Code outlines the procedure for US bankruptcy courts to acknowledge foreign insolvency proceedings. In November 2019, a significant milestone was achieved in the case of SBI V. SEL Mfg. Co. Ltd. In this case, the Indian insolvency proceedings pending before the NCLT, Chandigarh Bench, obtained recognition as a \u201cforeign main proceeding\u201d under Section 1502(4) of the US Bankruptcy Code. This recognition was granted by the US bankruptcy court following an application by the foreign representative, who identified India as the \u201ccentre of main interests\u201d for the foreign debtor, SEL Manufacturing. The court ruled that recognizing the Indian insolvency proceeding did not contravene US public policy. Furthermore, it stressed the importance of granting the foreign representative and the debtor the relief outlined in Section 1520 of the US Bankruptcy Code. This recognition ensures the maximization of asset value while responsibly considering the interests of creditors.ConclusionIndia currently lacks a proper legislative framework to govern cross-border insolvency disputes, which complicates matters for the judiciary when dealing with cases involving conflicts between Indian and foreign companies. A cross-border insolvency framework would improve the future stability of the Indian financial system by promoting transparency, financial stability, market integration, and efficient risk management. It would also help stakeholders promptly resolve issues in the enterprise sector and ensure efficient access to credit and allocation of resources, which would boost economic productivity and growth.", "The Rising Threat: Understanding Data Breaches and How to Prevent it\u00a0": "By Advocate Rishabh KumarPublished on: 27 September 2023 at 11:10 ISTThere is an eminent threat to our digital ecosystem that has been looming over our head that is cyber-attacks and Data breaches. In an era dominated by digital information and interconnected systems, the specter of data breaches is posing a significant threat to individuals and organizations alike.A data breach is characterized by unauthorized access to sensitive information that has emerged as a distinct form of cyberattack, giving rise to pressing concerns regarding data privacy and security.With the release of our latest Digital Personal Data Protection, Act 2023 (DPDP Act), we have armored ourselves against the Social engineers that have been rampant for quiet sometime now, with phishing emails, or text messages claiming to give money or reward. In this article, we will be comprehensively discussing regarding what is data breaches and its intricacies and present ways to protect your data from data breach.What is Data Breach?A data breach involves unauthorized access to sensitive information, and it is distinct from other cyberattacks. This breach can include personal and corporate data. Governments have imposed obligations on organizations to protect against cyber threats and report incidents. Compliance with cybersecurity and data breach reporting laws is now essential for most organizations, often involving multiple states and regulators.While The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDP Act) does not define Data Breach, it defines personal data breach as;\u201cpersonal data breach\u201d means any unauthorized processing of personal data or accidental disclosure, acquisition, sharing, use, alteration, destruction or loss of access to personal data, that compromises the confidentiality, integrity or availability of personal data.Rightly stating, not all data breaches are cyberattacks nor all cyberattacks are data breach.The global average cost of a data breach in 2022 was USD 4.35 million, with the United States experiencing an average cost of USD 9.44 million. Organizations across different sectors and sizes are susceptible to data breaches, with severe consequences, particularly in healthcare, finance, and the public sector, due to the nature of the data they handle.Need to Prevent Data BreachFinancial LossData breach costs stem from factors like lost business, expenses related to detecting and containing breaches, and post-breach costs, including fines and legal fees. Compliance with data breach reporting laws is essential, with different regulations in place at the state and Central levels.Personal Data\u201cPersonal data\u201d means any data about an individual who is identifiable by or in relation to such data. Protecting personal data is a right under the constitution of India and now under DPDP Act., as when an organization faces data breach, the personal data of their customers are widely speeded which eventually leads to decreasing customer loyalty.Confidentiality ConcernData be it corporate or private, everyone wants to protect their data from being misused. A company would not want its competitors getting hold of their business strategies. Neither would a private individual wants his browser history to be transmitted for targeted advertisements.How Data Breach happens?Data breaches can result from innocent mistakes, malicious insiders, or external hackers, primarily driven for financial gain. These breaches can involve stealing financial information, personally identifiable information, or trade secrets. Some breaches are purely destructive, aiming to damage an organization.Data breaches typically follow a pattern involving research, attack, and data compromise, with various attack vectors, including stolen credentials, social engineering, ransomware, system vulnerabilities, SQL injection, human errors, compromised credentials and physical security lapses.Notable data breaches from companies like Dominos, Yahoo, Equifax, SolarWinds, and Colonial Pipeline demonstrate the variety of causes and associated concerns that arises with respect to data breach.Process Research: The hacker looks for a target in a compromised system, they look for a weakness or weak point to exploit. They may buy previously stolen data or try a malware attack.Attack: After identifying a target and preparing the requisite modus operandi (MO). The hacker attacks direct to exploit the weakness. Be it a social engineering campaign, stolen credentials or any other vector.Compromise Data: After compromising the system, the hacker may either initiate a ransomware, lock, destroy or sell the data.Data Breach in IndiaThe average cost of a data breach in India reached an all-time high of Rs 17.9 crore in 2023, marking a nearly 28 percent increase since 2020, according to the IBM Security report. Phishing attacks were the most common type in India (22 percent), followed by stolen or compromised credentials (16 percent). Social engineering was the costliest root cause of breaches at Rs 19.1 crore, followed by malicious insider threats at nearly Rs 18.8 crore.Detection and escalation costs increased by 45 percent over the same period, representing the highest portion of breach costs and indicating a shift towards more complex breach investigations. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and automation played a significant role in increasing the data breach identification and containment for organizations. However, about 80% of studied organizations in India had limited (37%) or no use (43%) of AI and automation.Globally, the report found that businesses were divided in how they planned to handle the increasing cost and frequency of data breaches. While 95% of organizations studied globally had experienced more than one breach, they were more likely to pass incident costs onto consumers (57%) than to increase security investments (51%).In India, 28%t of data breaches resulted in the loss of data across multiple types of environments, indicating that attackers were able to compromise various environments while avoiding detection. Data breaches involving multiple environments had the highest associated breach costs (Rs 18.8 crore) and took the longest to identify and contain (327 days). Organizations in India that extensively used AI and automation experienced a significantly shorter data breach lifecycle compared to those that did not (225 days versus 378 days), resulting in nearly Rs 9.5 crore lower breach costs, making it the most significant cost-saving factor identified in the report.Recent Data Breaches in IndiaA major data breach with significant implications for national security has been uncovered by the Cyber Police. They arrested seven individuals allegedly involved in stealing and selling sensitive data from government agencies, including details of defense personnel, as well as personal and confidential information of approximately 16.8 crore citizens.The accused were selling data related to various sectors, such as Energy and Power, PAN card data, government employees, Gas and Petroleum, High Net-worth Individuals (HNIs), demat accounts, student databases, women databases, loan and insurance applicants, and private bank credit and debit card holders, among others.The data breach was discovered following a complaint to Cyber Police, and investigations are ongoing to determine how cybercriminals gained access to the data. The stolen information could be used for unauthorized access to important organizations, financial fraud, and various cybercrimes, raising significant concerns about data security and national security.The day when Dominos compromised with data of millions of its customers. Dominos faced allegations for accusations of leak of payment and card details which the company denied. The company did officially notify the costumers of the leak to forewarn them.13 TB worth of data was stolen by this attack, the hackers claimed to sell the data to anyone willing to pay 10 bitcoins.Laws Governing Data Breach in IndiaArticle 21 grants every Indian citizen the fundamental right to personal liberty which includes right to privacy and private data. This right has been the basis for Information Technology Act, 2000 (IT Act) vide Section 66E that deals with punishment for violation of privacy.Protection of databases is provided under the Copyright Act, 1957 (Copyright Act) along with IT Act for protection of data with penal provisions for compensation. Violation of which will lead to same deterrents in respect of person divulging the data without express consent.Section 8 (5) of the DPDP, imposes Data Fiduciary shall protect personal data in its possession or under its control, including in respect of any processing undertaken by it or on its behalf by a Data Processor, by taking reasonable security safeguards to prevent personal data breach.In the event of a personal data breach, the Data Fiduciary shall give the Board and each affected Data Principal, intimation of such breach in such form and manner as may be prescribed.Current penalties for data breach under IPC is Section 420 Cheating, IPC section 406 Criminal breach of Trust and Breach of Contract.Section 42 of IT Act imposes 10 million INR fine for downloading of data without consent, and 10 million for introducing virus into a computer system/computer.Under the DPDP Act, 2023; Failure to prevent a personal data breach incorporates the penalty up to 250cr and failure to notify the breach to the data principals up to 200cr.How to Prevent Data Breaches?If organizations are not aware of the risks associated with cybercrime it can be costly and damaging. Motivating and making them realize the need for data securitization is of first going concern. For organizational data protection you can implement these practices: \u2013MitigationPreventing and mitigating data breaches involves implementing security measures such as incident response plans, AI and automation, employee training, identity and access management (IAM), and adopting a zero-trust security approach. These measures help organizations detect, respond to, and mitigate the impact of data breaches, protecting sensitive data and reducing breach-related costs.Incident response plans (IRP)IRP of an organization is a blueprint for detecting, containing and eradicating cyberthreats\u2014is one of the most effective ways to mitigate the damage of a data breach. incident response teams have an average data breach cost of USD 3.26 million\u2014USD 2.66 million less than the average cost of a data breach for organizations without incident response teams and plans.AI and automation AI and digital access restrictions play a vital role in todays world to secure data. Use of technology such as SOAR (security orchestration, automation and response), UEBA (user and entity behavior analytics), EDR (endpoint detection and response) and XDR (extended detection and response) leverage AI and advanced analytics to identify threats early.Employee TrainingSocial engineering and phishing attacks are leading causes of breaches, training employees to recognize and avoid these attacks can reduce a company\u2019s risk of a data breach. In addition, training employees to handle data properly can help prevent accidental data breaches and data leaks.Identity and access ManagementSegregate the employees on the basis of their access level, this helps to create a roadmap and identify the breaching point. The more critical the data is, the more confidential or higher up the access will be. ensure to differentiate access points and vault systems with an encoder and private passkeys with time stamp on access timeline.Patch Management:Keep all software and systems up to date with security patches to Implement a regular patch management process.Data Encryption:Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit. Use encryption protocols like SSL/TLS for data in transit and encryption algorithms like AES for data at rest.ConclusionIn a rapidly evolving digital landscape, vigilance and preparedness against data breaches are paramount. By understanding the intricacies of data breaches and implementing proactive measures, individuals and organizations can navigate this complex terrain and safeguard their most sensitive information. Remember, in the digital age, data security is not just a choice but a fundamental necessity.", "What is International Commercial Arbitration Court": "By Martha Onate InaingoPublished on: 27 September 2023 at 10:30 ISTDisputes may arise between individuals, organizations, governments or countries, however the nature of the disputes and the subjects of the disputes determine how such disputes would be resolved. Generally, the disputes could be resolved through any of the dispute resolution processes: Arbitration, negotiation, mediation and litigation. Disputes that are of cross national borders are more complicated than the ones within national borders.In recent times most of the international disputes that arise as a result of economic, contractual and political relationships, are resolved through the process of International arbitration in arbitral institutions know as International Arbitration Courts.There are various International Courts of Arbitration that are particular to the kind of international dispute sought to be resolved. There are no restrictions as to nationality of the parties or arbitrators, location, language or law applicable to the court.Unlike domestic court judgments, international arbitration awards are enforcement in nearly all countries of the world, making international arbitration the leading mechanism for resolving international disputes.This article aims to delve into the general concept of international arbitration, the types of international arbitration (the crux of which is international commercial arbitration), its mechanics, how it stands out from other methods of resolving disputes and the role of the international arbitration court.The International Court of ArbitrationThe Permanent Court of Arbitration was the first institution established by treaty in 1899 for the purpose of providing a variety of dispute resolution services to intergovernmental organizations and the international community at large.[1]The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) International Court of Arbitration is an autonomous body of the International Chamber of Commerce.[2] It is also an arbitral institution established in 1923 as part of the ICC and headquartered in Paris.[3] Despite being called a court, it cannot make formal judgments on disputed matters. The court\u2019s functions are stipulated in Article 1 of the Statutes of the International Court of Arbitration, to include exercising judicial supervision over arbitration proceedings, ensuring the application of the 2021 ICC Rules of Arbitration, appointment, replacement and confirmation of nominated arbitrators by the parties, scrutinizing and approving all arbitral awards to reinforce quality and enforceability and assisting parties and arbitrators to overcome procedural obstacles.[4]Most international arbitration institutions provide rules which govern the resolution of disputes to be resolved via arbitration. The best-known rules of arbitration include those of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), the London Court of International Arbitration (LCIA), the International Centre for Dispute Resolution of the American Arbitration Association (ICDR), and the rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) and the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre (HKIAC). Investment arbitrations are often resolved under the rules of the World Bank\u2019s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) or the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) rules.[5]What Is International Arbitration?Arbitration is a process in which the parties to a dispute agree to have a neutral person or panel to resolve the dispute and reach a binding decision based on previously agreed terms and rules. In International arbitration the dispute is also referred to an impartial tribunal or panel which gives a binding decision based on International law.[6]The primary laws on which international arbitration is based are the governing laws of a contract or agreement, or the law of tort in relation to the contract, the arbitration laws of the seat of arbitration, procedural and substantive international treaties and national laws, as well as the procedural rules of the relevant arbitral institution, and the New York and Washington convention (alternatively known as the International Center for Settlement of Disputes- ICSID Convention).The United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards of 1958, also known as the New York Convention, is one International law that governs arbitration agreements and awards for 169 nations. The Convention requires national courts to recognize and enforce foreign arbitral awards and arbitration agreements.[7]International arbitration is therefore, a method of dispute resolution where the parties agree to resolve their disputes before private arbitrators instead of a national court. For most cross-border transactions, international arbitration is generally recognized as the preferred dispute resolution mechanism because it creates a neutral forum, awards are usually easier to enforce than court judgments, and parties can choose who decides their dispute.[8]International arbitration is similar to arbitration under municipal laws, which takes place before arbitrators or adjudicators in recognized institutions under International law. This process is usually consensual, neutral, binding, private and enforceable means of international dispute resolution, which is typically faster and less expensive than domestic court proceedings.International arbitration can be used to resolve any dispute that is considered to be \u201carbitrable,\u201d this covers from State-to-State disputes the majority of which are commercial or contractual disputes.[9] International arbitration has evolved to resolve disputes between parties in a final and binding manner, without formalities of the procedural rules of the legal systems peculiar to the parties or subjects of the disputes.Significant Features of International ArbitrationInternational arbitration is often described as a hybrid form of international dispute resolution because of how it blends elements of civil law procedure and common law procedure, while allowing the parties a significant level of flexibility to design or influence the arbitral procedure under which their dispute will be resolved. International Arbitration has the following key characteristics:[10]One of the main advantages of international arbitration over litigation is that in most countries, international arbitration awards are easier to enforce than foreign court judgments. Over 170 countries have ratified a multilateral treaty for the recognition and enforcement of International arbitration agreements and awards called the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards of 1958 (also known as the New York Convention). Under the New York Convention, non-domestic arbitral awards are enforceable in any of the ratifying states subject to certain narrow exceptions.International arbitration provides a neutral platform for resolving cross-border disputes. This is particularly important when the parties want to avoid giving the other local court any advantage, or where the domestic judicial system of one party may be unfamiliar, complex, or challenging to navigate.Unlike court proceedings and filings, the submissions, rulings, and orders issued by an international arbitral tribunal are generally not available to the public and are communicated only to the parties. Hearings are also not open to the public. Further, the parties can agree that the existence and content of the arbitration will be kept confidential.Parties can specify any qualifications for arbitrators in their arbitration clause, such as experience in a certain area of the law, industry, subject area, or otherwise select arbitrators that have the background or expertise they know that are relevant to the case.Generally, an arbitration award is final and binding and there is no right of appeal. Also, awards usually cannot be set aside (or vacated) except under limited circumstances; mostly centered on due process or the power of the arbitrators, and not the merits of the award.Since, International arbitration is a private and mutually agreed-upon form of dispute resolution, it is less formal than judicial proceedings and allows the parties a degree of flexibility and autonomy to agree on things like how the arbitration should be conducted, the procedural rules, and where the arbitration hearing should be held.Types of International ArbitrationThere are three main types of international arbitration with principles and processes that re in common, however, the type of dispute, nature of the rules or terms agreed by the parties to apply in the case of any dispute determine the type of arbitration to be considered.[11] The types of arbitration are discussed below:This is recent phenomenon that is rapidly growing and gaining recognition as one of the types of International arbitration. It concerns the initiation of arbitration proceedings by foreign investors against States on the basis of bilateral or multilateral investment treaties, or domestic laws providing consent to arbitration by the State. It may be the only recourse in response to the expropriation of private investments by a State e.g Petroleum Expropriation in foreign countries.Investment arbitration otherwise known as, Investor-state arbitration gives foreign investors the right to \u201csue a host government for compensation before an international arbitration tribunal when they have been aggrieved by that government\u2019s actions.\u201d[12] This marks a radical departure from earlier methods of settling such disputes, which required the investors to rely on diplomatic protection by their home countries. By 2021, investors had sued 124 governments in over 1,100 cases brought under the category of investor-state arbitration; many of which resulted in arbitral awards totaling hundreds of millions of dollars.[13]In interstate arbitration, countries or states are represented by their governments to resolve disputes between them through arbitration. Although, interstate arbitration is essentially a legal process, it cannot be viewed only in legal terms because that would mean overlooking its tactical and strategic importance in enabling contending states under appropriate conditions to settle significant international conflicts.[14]One classical example is the Red Sea Islands Arbitration between Eritrea and Yemen which was aimed at settling competing claims to some uninhabited rocks in the Red Sea. But the International arbitration had the broader advantage of providing a face-saving way to end a dangerous military confrontation in 1995 that threatened an important global trade route.[15]In 2013, the Rules were further amended to incorporate the UNCITRAL Rules on Transparency in Treaty-based Investor-State Arbitration, application of which is promoted by United Nations Convention on Transparency in Treaty-based Investor-State Arbitration (New York, 2014) or the Mauritius Convention on Transparency.[16]Despite its potential power of interstate arbitration as a means of resolving international conflict it is seldom utilized remains a largely forgotten item at the bottom of the dispute settlement toolbox, overlooked in books, articles, and courses in conflict resolution.[17] Utilizing this form of arbitration would result to greater good, global peace and healthy diplomatic relations among nations.International trade and the global economy have made international commercial contracts and transactions to be on the rise. These days Commercial contracts between private persons, organizations, companies and governments cut across more than one State. [18]In the course of executing these contracts, disputes may arise and because of the international nature of the contracts, resorting to municipal courts may not be suitable because of the risk of exposing the subject matter of the suit to the public, national prejudice of the host legal systems and wasting business time in litigation. This makes International Commercial Arbitration (ICA) to be desirable, because it is fast, efficient and for the confidentiality.As a result, most contracts between corporations from different countries contain a dispute resolution clause specifying that any disputes arising under the contract will be handled through arbitration rather than litigation.[19]International commercial arbitration is governed by various international conventions and national laws, including the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration. This model law provides a comprehensive framework for the conduct of international commercial arbitration proceedings.[20]What is the Role of the International Commercial Arbitration Court?Although different international commercial courts opt for different arbitration features by infusing greater flexibility into their proceedings, appointing foreign nationality judges, permitting foreign lawyers to appear before them, allowing parties to agree on private and confidential proceedings and expanding the enforceability of their judgments by turning court judgments into arbitral awards. By allowing parties to shape proceedings by their agreement, international commercial courts offer tailor-made proceedings and increased flexibility.[21]Rights and Responsibilities of Parties in an International Commercial ArbitrationFirst and foremost, the Parties must agree to arbitrate and the most common way they do so is by including an arbitration clause in their commercial agreements. In the circumference that there is no arbitration clause in the agreement, parties can also agree to submit a dispute to arbitration for resolution after it has arisen. This is called a submission agreement.[22] The submission agreement would contain the aforementioned elements and once the other party accepts the request, the dispute would be referred to arbitration.[23]A typical arbitration agreement is very short. For instance, the clause can be according to the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) model arbitration clause, which merely reads:All disputes arising out of or in connection with the present contract shall be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with the said Rules.[24]In the arbitration clause, the parties can agree on critical parts of the arbitral process, specifying the arbitral institution that will administer the arbitration, the number of arbitrators and how they will be appointed, the forum or legal place of arbitration (also called the \u2018seat\u2019), the language of the arbitration, procedural rules and the governing law of the arbitration (which does not need to be the same as the substantive law governing the contract).What is the scope of the Arbitrators\u2019 Authority?The scope of the arbitrators\u2019 authority is determined by the arbitration clause and the law of the seat of arbitration. The arbitral process concludes with the arbitrators issuing a final award, which is binding on the parties and can be enforced in most courts around the world. There is usually no right of appeal and the award can only be set aside (or vacated) on limited grounds.Why International Commercial Arbitration?There are several advantages to using international commercial arbitration to resolve cross-border disputes.ConclusionInternational arbitration is a consensual, neutral, binding, private and enforceable means of resolving or settling international dispute, based on International law and by an international arbitration panel or institution which is typically faster and less expensive than domestic court proceedings. Unlike domestic court judgments, international arbitration awards can be enforced in nearly all countries of the world, making international arbitration the leading mechanism for resolving international disputes.Paris Arbitration, International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) International Court of Arbitration, available at,https://parisarbitration.com/en/glossaire/international-chamber-commerce-icc-international-court-arbitration/, accessed September 25, 2023. \u2191 Jeswald W.

These companies typically have a global reach, significant market capitalization, and a major impact on various aspects of the tech industry and the broader economy.Tech giants like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple etc tends to evade scrutiny, as people seem to have respect and loyalty towards these companies, and hardly bat an eye towards their invasion of privacy.A surge in recent instances of corporate governance failures has cast a shadow of doubt not only on the effectiveness of board oversight but also on the prevalence of compliance irregularities within major tech giants.As these Tech Giants like Amazon, Google, Oracle, Apple and the likes continue to expand their influence across various tech frontiers like cloud computing and engage in what some perceive as unfair trade practices, concerns have emerged about potential malpractices and malfunctions in their corporate governance structures.This trend raises critical questions about ethical conduct, transparency, and accountability in the tech industry, in this article we will be comprehensively discussing regarding the malpractices committed by these tech companies as shedding light on such a complex landscape of corporate governance woes that demand close examination and reform.Malpractices by Tech GiantsTech giants, like any large corporations, can be involved in various controversies and allegations of malpractices. It\u2019s important to note that not all tech giants engage in malpractices, and many of these allegations are subject to legal investigations and public scrutiny. Some common areas where tech giants have faced allegations of malpractices include:Case Study on Involvement of Google in Malpractice The Competition Commission of India (CCI) had been investigating Google for alleged anti-competitive practices. These investigations were related to Google\u2019s dominance in the online search and advertising markets.The Competition Commission of India (CCI) imposed a 1337 crore fine on Google for abusing its dominant position in the android ecosystem in India.There has been a lack of Personal data protection bill or any dedicated laws which can specifically prohibit such practices, tech giants had been trading in the grey areas with unfair trade practices and abuse of dominant position.It was one of the biggest high-profile cases between a tech giant and regulator. Even NCLAT upheld the CCI penalty in this case, while it may seem as a win for the regulators but we still need a comprehensive data protection law and tech company regulatory guidelines like EU.CCI flagged multiple instances where Google had abused its market dominance and was not limited to only mandating pre-installation of key Google apps like Chrome, Google search, Youtube, Google Maps, etc.NCLAT largely backed the CCI\u2019s findings in its final verdict, but there were also some relaxations for Google, Google won\u2019t have to host third-party app stores inside the Play Store; it will also not need to allow users to remove pre-installed apps like Gmail and YouTubeThe body has held that Google forcing original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to pre-install apps is an abuse of its dominant position. It has also held that there was no violation of the principles of natural justice, and the lack of a judicial member did not affect the CCI\u2019s decision.However, the NCLAT has upheld six CCI directions, stating that Google cannot force OEMs to pre-install a suite of apps, position apps in a certain way, license the Play Store to be linked to Chrome, Search, Maps, YouTube, or other apps, pay OEMs for search service exclusivity, impose anti-fragmentation obligations on OEMs, or prevent OEMs from selling smart devices based on Android forks. Additionally, Google must allow users to choose their default search engine during device setup.The CCI had imposed a penalty on Google for anti-competitive practices related to Android mobile devices, which Google challenged before the NCLAT. Google contended that the investigation was tainted and the CCI failed to conduct an impartial and legally sound investigation.The NCLAT\u2019s ruling is expected to have significant implications for tech companies operating in India and may set a precedent for the operation of dominant players in tech markets and their relationships with OEMs and app developers.The appeal against the order of NCLAT filed by Google will be heard by Supreme court on 10th October, 2023. This case highlights the allegations on Google abusing its dominant position in the market.Case Study: Alleged Malpractices by Amazon in India Sparks ControversyIn a recent turn of events, US Senator Elizabeth Warren has called for the breakup of tech giant Amazon. Simultaneously, Indian retailers are demanding a government investigation into the company following a damning Reuters investigation that uncovered alleged malpractices by Amazon in India. The report has exposed Amazon\u2019s tactics, including copying products and manipulating search results to promote its private brands in the rapidly growing Indian market.The investigative report, based on internal Amazon documents, paints a concerning picture of the company\u2019s strategies in India. It revealed a systematic effort by Amazon to create imitation products and manipulate search results to favor its own brands. Amazon employees, as per the internal documents, extensively studied proprietary data of other brands on Amazon.in, including customer return information. Their goal was to identify specific products, often referred to as \u201creference\u201d or \u201cbenchmark\u201d products, and replicate them. Amazon\u2019s 2016 internal report outlined the strategy for their Indian brand, \u201cSolimo,\u201d which involved using data from Amazon.in to develop and market products on the same platform.Surprisingly, Amazon\u2019s Solimo project in India has had international repercussions, with numerous Solimo-branded health and household products now available on Amazon\u2019s U.S. website, Amazon.com.The 2016 document also revealed that Amazon employees working on private-brand products aimed to collaborate with the manufacturers of the products they intended to copy. This partnership was sought because these manufacturers possessed unique expertise and processes that influenced the quality of the products. The document referred to this manufacturer expertise as \u201cTribal Knowledge.\u201dThese revelations provide insight into Amazon\u2019s practices, which the company had long denied. Amazon\u2019s founder, Jeff Bezos, testified before the U.S. Congress in 2020, stating that the company prohibited the use of individual seller data to benefit its private-label business. Additionally, another Amazon executive in 2019 claimed that the company did not use such data to create its private-label products or favor them in search results.Senator Elizabeth Warren, a vocal critic of Amazon, expressed her concerns on Twitter, stating that these documents confirm her fears about Amazon\u2019s monopoly power and its willingness to manipulate its platform to benefit itself while harming small businesses and entrepreneurs. She reiterated her call to break up the company.The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), a group representing millions of Indian brick-and-mortar retailers, called for a government investigation into Amazon\u2019s practices. CAIT alleges that the e-commerce giant is causing significant disadvantages to small manufacturers and retailers in India, representing 80 million retail stores.Amazon responded to the report by vehemently denying the claims, stating that they were factually incorrect and unsubstantiated. The company insisted that its search results are based on relevance to customer queries and denied using unfair practices to promote its private-label products.The Alliance of Digital India Foundation (ADIF), a non-profit representing Indian startups, condemned Amazon\u2019s practices as \u201chighly deplorable\u201d and questioned the company\u2019s credibility as a good faith operator in the Indian startup ecosystem. They called on the Indian government to take action against Amazon\u2019s alleged predatory tactics.Furthermore, a top official from the economic wing of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the ideological parent of India\u2019s ruling party, urged consumers to boycott Amazon in response to the revelations.The allegations of malpractices by Amazon in India have ignited a firestorm of controversy and calls for action. With US Senator Elizabeth Warren advocating for a breakup and Indian retailers demanding a government investigation, the outcome of these revelations could have significant implications for Amazon\u2019s operations in India and beyond. The spotlight is now on Amazon as it faces intense scrutiny and public backlash over these alleged actions.Tech Giant Oracle: Lay-offThe reports have shed light on Oracle, a major player in the IT industry, initiating staff downsizing in various countries, including India. These reports suggest that thousands of employees may face job losses. This trend of layoffs within the tech sector is largely attributed to companies gearing up for a challenging economic landscape by reducing their workforce.To circumvent these legal procedures and reduce costs, some companies resort to pressuring employees to resign voluntarily, which is illegal. Employees facing such situations are encouraged to refuse to resign and insist on following the legal process, as there is no legal procedure for mass terminations in India.The Battle for Control in Cloud ComputingAlphabet\u2019s Google, in collaboration with technology trade groups, has lodged complaints with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), raising concerns about purported unfair business practices within the cloud computing industry. Notably, these complaints encompass prominent industry players, including Microsoft. The FTC had solicited information pertaining to security and competition within the cloud data storage and computing sector, to which these comments were a response.Global Scrutiny and Antitrust Investigations:The cloud industry has come under global scrutiny, with Europe\u2019s antitrust authority recently launching an investigation into Microsoft\u2019s licensing agreements. These agreements were suspected of stifling competition within the cloud space, sparking concerns about fairness and equity in the market.Fee Controversy:Another point of contention revolves around fees associated with migrating data across different cloud providers. Trade group NetChoice, counting Amazon.com and Google among its members, has accused certain vendors, including Microsoft and Oracle, of deploying anti-competitive tactics to maintain their dominance in the cloud industry. These alleged practices hinder customers from switching providers to access more cost-effective solutions, superior services, and innovative offerings.Google\u2019s Perspective:Google has voiced these concerns, emphasizing that Microsoft and other legacy software providers employ licensing terms that distort the competitive landscape within the cloud. Google argues that businesses procuring software from Microsoft for their data centers encounter limitations and additional charges when transitioning these licenses to Microsoft\u2019s cloud competitors.Amazon\u2019s Criticisms:Amazon has previously raised similar criticisms. Up to the time of this report, Microsoft and Oracle have not officially responded to Reuters\u2019 requests for comments. While Microsoft has implemented some updates to its terms in response to criticism, competitors have deemed these changes insufficient.The cloud computing industry is witnessing intense competition and growing concerns about equitable practices. With Alphabet\u2019s Google, along with other industry stakeholders, raising complaints with the FTC and Europe\u2019s antitrust authority investigating licensing agreements, the cloud landscape is poised for potential transformations. As the battle for control continues, the industry\u2019s future may depend on achieving a balance between fostering innovation and ensuring fair competition for the benefit of all stakeholders.Role of CCI in Controlling Malpractices in IndiaThe Competition Commission of India (CCI) plays a crucial role in diminishing malpractices by tech giants and promoting fair competition in the Indian market.Here are some key ways in which CCI contributes:Antitrust Enforcement: CCI is responsible for enforcing antitrust laws in India. It investigates and takes action against anti-competitive practices, such as abuse of dominant market positions, cartelization, and anti-competitive mergers and acquisitions. Tech giants with significant market power are not exempted from these regulations.Investigating Monopoly and Abuse of Dominance: CCI investigates cases where tech giants may abuse their dominant positions in the market to stifle competition. For example, if a tech giant uses its market power to impose unfair terms on competitors or customers, CCI can step in to address such practices.Reviewing Mergers and Acquisitions: CCI reviews mergers and acquisitions involving tech companies to ensure that they do not result in anti-competitive outcomes. The commission assesses whether such transactions would lead to a substantial lessening of competition in the market.Imposing Penalties: CCI has the authority to impose penalties on tech giants found guilty of anti-competitive practices. These penalties can act as deterrents and encourage compliance with competition laws.Market Studies and Advocacy: CCI conducts market studies and advocacy efforts to identify and address competition concerns proactively. Through these studies, CCI can gain insights into market dynamics and potential malpractices by tech giants.Consumer Protection: CCI also plays a role in protecting consumer interests by ensuring that tech companies do not engage in unfair or deceptive trade practices that harm consumers.Promoting Innovation: CCI\u2019s efforts to maintain a competitive marketplace can encourage innovation by preventing monopolistic behavior that stifles new entrants and disruptive technologies.Legal Framework Development: CCI continuously works on improving the legal framework governing competition in India. This may involve revising existing regulations or proposing new ones to address emerging challenges in the tech industry.Cooperation with International Authorities: Given the global nature of tech giants, CCI often cooperates with international competition authorities to address cross-border competition issues and share information regarding malpractices.Providing a Fair Platform: By ensuring fair competition, CCI helps create a level playing field for both established tech giants and emerging startups, fostering an environment where innovative ideas and businesses can thrive.Hence, the CCI plays a vital role in regulating tech giants and diminishing malpractices in India\u2019s tech sector. Its enforcement of competition laws, investigation of anti-competitive behavior, and promotion of fair competition contribute to a healthier and more competitive tech ecosystem in the country.ConclusionThe practices of tech giants have been in a subject of scrutiny and debate, with various allegations and concerns raised over the years. While these companies have played a transformative role in shaping the digital landscape and driving technological innovation, they have not been immune to criticism and controversies.Tech giants continue to evolve their practices, often in response to regulatory pressures and public scrutiny. The tech industry remains dynamic, and the role of these companies in society continues to be a subject of ongoing discussion and debate. As the digital landscape evolves, it is essential for tech giants to strike a balance between innovation, competition, and responsible corporate behavior to meet the expectations of consumers, regulators, and the broader public.Referenceshttps://www.livemint.com/companies/news/google-and-other-tech-companies-accuse-microsoft-of-unfair-practices-in-cloud-11687395111937.htmlhttps://medium.com/tech-people/tech-workers-mass-layoffs-are-mostly-illegal-743010e6867dhttps://twitter.com/i/web/status/1448525157476175879https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/amazon-india-rigging/", "Kerala HC Uses Parens Patriae Jurisdiction to Name Child Amidst Parental Dispute": "LI NetworkPublished on: 01 October 2023 at 13:35 ISTThe Kerala High Court has exercised its parens patriae jurisdiction to select the name for a child who found herself embroiled in a disagreement between her estranged parents regarding her name.Justice Bechu Kurian Thomas rationalized that attempting to mediate the parental dispute would inevitably cause delays, and during this time, the absence of a name would not serve the child\u2019s best interests or welfare.\u201cIn the exercise of such jurisdiction, where the welfare of the child takes precedence over the rights of the parents, the Court must undertake the task of choosing a name for the child. When selecting a name, the court may consider factors such as the child\u2019s welfare, cultural considerations, parental interests, and societal norms. With the ultimate goal being the child\u2019s well-being, the court must choose a name that takes into account the overall circumstances. Therefore, this Court is compelled to exercise its parens patriae jurisdiction to choose a name for the petitioner\u2019s child,\u201d the Court stated.The child in question did not have a name on her birth certificate. As the child was about to start her education, school authorities insisted on a name for her and refused to accept the birth certificate, which had no name. When the petitioner mother attempted to register a name for the child, specifically \u2018Punya Nair,\u2018 the Registrar insisted on the presence of both parents before him to register the name. However, the couple could not reach a consensus on the issue, as the father wanted to name the child \u2018Padma Nair.\u2018It\u2019s worth noting that the couple\u2019s relationship had soured after the child\u2019s birth. Initially, the petitioner had sought assistance from the Family Court to compel her husband to cooperate in obtaining a birth certificate for the child with the name \u2018Punya Nair.\u2019The Family Court had directed both parents to appear before the Secretary of the Aluva Municipality to process the birth certificate, but this directive was not followed, leaving the child still without a name.\u201cUndoubtedly, the child must be given a name. Fortunately, the parties are in agreement on this matter. Thus, the issue comes down to what name should be entered on the birth certificate. A name establishes an identity that typically remains with a person for life, unless changed by choice,\u201d the bench noted.Considering the Registrar\u2019s requirement that both parents apply to register the child\u2019s name, the Court also addressed whether the registration of a name in the birth certificate necessitates an application by both parents or just one of them.Upon reviewing Section 14 of the Registration of Births and Deaths Act, 1969 (\u2018Registration of name of child\u2019) and Rule 10 of the Kerala Registration of Births and Deaths Rules, 1999, which pertains to the period of purpose for Section 14 of the Act, Justice Thomas determined that the provisions used the term \u2018the parent,\u2019 which could refer to either the father or the mother, or in exceptional cases, both. The Court emphasized that the context in which the term was used would determine its interpretation.The Court concluded that since the Act and the Rules used the term \u2018the parent\u2019 in the singular form and not in the plural, either the father or the mother could register the child\u2019s name.\u201cIn cases where a dispute arises between the parents regarding the child\u2019s name, it is essential for one of them to be entitled to appear before the Registrar of Births and Deaths to provide a name. The statute does not mandate the appearance of both parents when a dispute exists. This interpretation is critical in light of the increasing prevalence of \u2018single parents\u2019 and in consideration of the child\u2019s best interests,\u201d the Court stated.The Court acknowledged that this interpretation might lead to situations where one parent hastily registers their chosen name for the child. However, the Court emphasized that such possibilities should not prompt an interpretation that disregards the terminology used in the statute and rules. It added that if either parent later wishes to correct the name, they can initiate legal proceedings to do so.Additionally, the Court scrutinized a 2016 Government Circular that allowed corrections to be made based on the application of the parent who has custody of the child after the dissolution of marriage or the abandonment of the child by either parent. The Court determined that while the Circular was well-intentioned, the power to issue it could not be traced back to the Act or the Rules, except for Section 32 of the Act, which can be used to overcome difficulties in implementing the Act, but only for a maximum of two years.Consequently, the Court held that the State Government lacked the authority to issue such a Circular.Considering the facts of the case, the Court determined that the name proposed by the mother, with whom the child currently resided, should be given due consideration. Furthermore, the Court believed that the father\u2019s name should also be included since his paternity was undisputed.As a result, the Court decided on the name \u2018Punya Balagangadharan Nair\u2019 or \u2018Punya B. Nair\u2019 for the child.To resolve the disputes between the parties regarding the child\u2019s name, the child is directed to be named \u2018Punya,\u2019 and the father\u2019s name, \u2018Balagangadharan,\u2019 should also be added along with \u2018Nair.\u2019 Therefore, the daughter of the petitioner, born on 12-02-2020, to the fourth respondent, is hereby named \u2018Punya Balagangad.", "Orissa HC Upholds Advocate Innocence as Party\u2019s Negligence Lead to Delay in Court Order": "LI NetworkPublished on: 01 October 2023 at 13:06 ISTThe Orissa High Court recently affirmed that an advocate cannot be held responsible for a significant delay in complying with a court order, stemming from the sheer negligence of a party.The bench, comprising Chief Justice Subhasis Talapatra and Justice Sangam Kumar Sahoo, emphasized that while it may be simple to change lawyers and place blame on a previous attorney for negligence, the court cannot disregard the surrounding circumstances, events, and, most importantly, the behavior of the party. Allegations made by the party against their advocate cannot be accepted as gospel truth without proper consideration.In this case, the petitioner, Shankarlal Patwari, filed a writ petition seeking to quash an order issued by the Tahasildar -cum- O.E.A. Collector.The petitioner claimed in the petition that he genuinely believed his counsel was competently handling the case. However, he later discovered that the writ petition had been dismissed due to non-compliance with the court\u2019s order to submit postal requisites within the stipulated time.The petition further stated that the petitioner was unaware of the order, and his counsel had failed to inform him about the court\u2019s directive. Due to the negligence of the attorney, the postal requisites were not filed, resulting in the writ petition\u2019s dismissal for default without being referred to the bench.Upon investigating the matter, the petitioner learned that Sri Bidyadhar Mishra, Advocate, who had represented him in the writ petition, had not been attending court for several years and was residing in Bhubaneswar.The High Court noted that when the petitioner had entrusted his case to his advocate in 2006, he should have maintained contact with his lawyer to monitor the case\u2019s progress. The case was first heard on November 21, 2006, when notice was ordered to be issued, but the requisites were not filed on time. Subsequently, the matter came before the court almost a decade later, indicating that the petitioner had not kept in touch with his advocate to inquire about the case\u2019s status. Consequently, it could be concluded that he was careless and negligent in pursuing his case.The bench stated that a party\u2019s duty is to select an advocate, provide instructions, pay the required fees, and trust the advocate to handle the rest. After engaging a lawyer, a party should have confidence that the lawyer will safeguard their interests. A party should not be made to suffer for the inaction, negligence, or other faults of the advocate.The High Court observed that the petitioner had not diligently pursued the case. An order had been issued, directing the filing of requisites, but the petitioner\u2019s counsel had failed to comply. It is unlikely that a vigilant litigant would not take the slightest effort to inquire about the case\u2019s status until the next listing, which occurred nearly a decade later.The bench reiterated that it is straightforward to change lawyers and blame a previous attorney for negligence. However, the court must consider the circumstances, events, and the party\u2019s behavior before accepting allegations against the advocate as true. Additionally, the concerned lawyer was not a party to the case, making it unfair to pass judgment on the lawyer\u2019s conduct without affording them an opportunity to be heard.The High Court determined that the delay of 1391 days in filing the petition was excessive. The petitioner had not presented a sufficient cause to justify condoning the delay, and the explanation offered was not credible. Given that the discretion to condone delay must be exercised judiciously to avoid defeating the purpose of limitation laws and causing injustice, the bench declined to accept the explanation provided in the interim application for condoning the delay.Consequently, the petition was dismissed.", "Kerala HC Emphasizes Timely Application of Order VII Rule 11 for Plaint Rejection": "LI NetworkPublished on: 01 October 2023 at 12:54 ISTThe Kerala High Court has clarified that a trial judge must not delay the decision to reject a plaint until the conclusion of the trial. Instead, such a determination should be based solely on an evaluation of the plaint as per Order VII Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC).Justice Devan Ramachandran emphasized that when a trial judge postpones the rejection of a plaint until the end of the trial, it defeats the purpose of Order VII Rule 11 CPC.The court noted that Order VII Rule 11 requires a clear mention of the cause of action in the plaint for the suit\u2019s initiation. If this requirement is not met, the court can reject the plaint.The case involved a summons received by the petitioner from the Munsiff\u2019s Court regarding a lawsuit filed against them by the first respondent. The petitioner promptly sought the rejection of the plaintiff\u2019s claim under Order VII Rule 11, arguing that the plaint did not disclose a valid cause of action. It was also alleged that the statements in the plaint contradicted the stand taken by the respondents in a previous suit and were barred by law, amounting to an abuse of the legal process.The petitioner claimed that the Munsiff rejected the application without considering its merits, misunderstanding the purpose of Order VII Rule 11, which aims to eliminate unworthy lawsuits at their outset.Dissatisfied with the Munsiff Court\u2019s decision, the petitioner appealed to the High Court.The petitioner\u2019s counsel argued that the Munsiff\u2019s order was inconsistent with Order VII Rule 11, which is intended to eliminate unworthy plaints at the beginning, without waiting for the trial. It was asserted that when a plaint does not disclose a valid cause of action, it can be rejected under Order VII Rule 11, and there is no need to wait for the trial to conclude.The respondents\u2019 counsel contended that the Munsiff\u2019s order was valid, as a decision regarding the petitioner\u2019s claim could only be made after the trial.Advocate Millu Dandapani, counsel for the ninth respondent, supported the petitioner\u2019s position, stating that when a lawsuit lacks a valid cause of action or is affected by the conditions mentioned in Order VII Rule 11, the trial judge must reject it outright and not wait until the trial concludes.The Court emphasized that the purpose of Order VII Rule 11 is to assess the plaintiff\u2019s claim at the outset, determining whether it should be rejected for any valid reasons. The Court clarified that the Munsiff could reject the plaint under Order VII Rule 11 based solely on an assessment of the plaint, provided it met the specified criteria.The Court found the Munsiff\u2019s order, which postponed the rejection of the plaint until after the trial, unreasonable and contrary to the provision\u2019s purpose. It noted that a Trial Judge\u2019s role is to determine whether the plaint is an abuse of the legal process and if any of the prohibiting factors listed in the rule apply, rendering it incompetent and unsuitable for prosecution.Consequently, the Court granted the petition and instructed the Trial Court to reconsider the petitioner\u2019s application for plaint rejection and issue an appropriate order within one month.", "Kerala HC Invalidates Appointments of Anganwadi Workers Made by Child Development Officer": "LI NetworkPublished on: 01 October 2023 at 12:47 ISTThe Kerala High Court has ruled that the appointment of two Anganwadi workers by the Child Development Project Officer, instead of the Village Panchayat, is illegal. The decision was based on Section 166(2) of the Kerala Panchayat Raj Act, 1994, which grants exclusive authority to Village Panchayats to administer matters related to Anganwadis.Justice Raja Vijayaraghavan V., presiding over a single-judge bench, emphasized the exclusive power vested in Village Panchayats to administer Anganwadi-related matters, subject to the provisions of the Act and government guidelines and assistance. In essence, the Village Panchayat is responsible for decisions concerning Anganwadis.The case originated when Kadapra Panchayat decided to appoint permanent Anganwadi workers in 2016. However, due to complaints and a delayed publication of the rank list, the process was canceled. The petitioner had been working as a temporary Anganwadi worker from 2016 to 2023. Following a circular issued by the Women and Child Development Department, the Child Development Project Officer selected the 5th and 6th respondents for the Anganwadi worker positions.The petitioner argued that Section 166 of the Act granted exclusive power to Village Panchayats for administering Anganwadi matters. She also cited the decision in Valanchery Service Co-operative Bank Ltd v. State of Kerala (2006) to contend that the actions of the Child Development Project Officer undermined the independence of Panchayat Raj institutions. Consequently, she sought the annulment of the illegal appointments of the 5th and 6th respondents.The petitioner also pointed out the absence of a clear procedure for appointing Anganwadi workers and referred to the decision in Padmini & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors. (2021), which suggested that retirees from these positions could be engaged on a contract basis if the posts were not filled in accordance with government rules. Therefore, she requested her re-engagement on a contract basis until a proper selection procedure was established by law.The respondents argued that the appointments were made in accordance with the circular issued by the Women and Child Development Department, and they satisfied the qualifications and reservation criteria.The Court, after examining Section 166 of the Act and the precedent in Valanchery Service Co-operative Bank Ltd., upheld the petitioner\u2019s argument regarding the appointments of the 5th and 6th respondents and annulled them.However, the Court deemed it appropriate for the Panchayat to decide whether the petitioner should be re-engaged on a contract basis until a selection procedure for Anganwadi workers was established. It directed the Panchayat to consider this matter and make a decision in accordance with the law.The plea was thus resolved.", "Kerala HC Stresses Adherence to Organ Transplant Rules": "LI NetworkPublished on: 01 October 2023 at 12:42 ISTThe Kerala High Court has emphasized the need to adhere to legal requirements outlined in organ transplant rules and cautioned against diluting these rules on a case-by-case basis. The court was hearing a plea by kidney patients on life support who were seeking kidney transplantation.Justice Devan Ramachandran directed the District Level Authorization Committee for Transplantation of Human Organs (DLAC) to determine whether the petitioners needed to obtain a \u2018Certificate of Altruism.\u2019 The court stressed that established rules for organ donation should not be relaxed or diluted individually.The petitioners had faced difficulties as the hospital did not forward their requests for kidney transplantation to the DLAC due to the absence of a Police Clearance Certificate (PCC). They argued that the PCC requirement was outdated based on the Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Rules.Government Pleader Sunil Kumar Kuriakose agreed that a PCC was no longer necessary. He clarified that the petitioners needed a \u2018Certificate of Altruism\u2019 from the District Superintendent of Police or Deputy Superintendent of Police, depending on the donor and recipient\u2019s jurisdiction.The Court emphasized strict compliance with the law to maintain the integrity of the organ donation process. It decided to leave the matter to the DLAC\u2019s discretion after receiving clarification from the Government Pleader. The Convenor of the Local Committee was instructed to forward the petitioners\u2019 applications and necessary documents, excluding the Certificate of Altruism, to the DLAC within a week.The DLAC was directed to complete the processes leading to necessary permissions within one month if no Certificate of Altruism was required. If the certificate was deemed necessary, the DLAC was instructed to inform the petitioners within two weeks from the date of receiving applications from the Local Committee. The petitioners would then need to obtain and present the certificate to the Authority in accordance with the law.The DLAC was tasked with making a final decision on the petitioners\u2019 request within one month from the date on which the Certificate is produced.", "Calcutta HC: Claims for damages must meet credibility threshold & cannot be based on mere \u201cguesstimates\u201d without a legal basis": "LI NetworkPublished on: 01 October 2023 at 12:41 ISTThe case involved the National Jute Manufactures Corporation Limited (NJMC) forfeiting the pre-bid earnest money deposited by the petitioner in response to a call for e-auction. The petitioner sought a refund of the earnest money and challenged the forfeiture.Justice Moushumi Bhattacharya, in allowing the petitioner\u2019s plea for a refund, emphasized that NJMC must prove actual loss or damage resulting from the petitioner\u2019s refusal to proceed with the auction. The estimation of damages provided by NJMC was found to be inflated, exaggerated, unreasonable, and lacked a basis for computation. The court noted that NJMC was seeking an unwarranted windfall at the petitioner\u2019s expense, and its actions were discriminatory and contrary to principles of equality and fair play.The petitioner had deposited a substantial amount in response to an e-auction for movable assets and subsequently sought clarifications from NJMC regarding asset demarcation and material removal, which were not provided. The petitioner, concerned about further liabilities, refused to accept NJMC\u2019s offer to proceed with the auction.The central dispute centered on a clause in the e-auction catalog\u2019s terms and conditions, which allowed for the forfeiture of earnest money if a bidder failed to fulfill the auction\u2019s terms and conditions.The court held that the forfeiture clause was unconscionable and contrary to principles of equity and natural justice. It emphasized that fairness was particularly important when one contracting party was a government entity, and the other party had unequal bargaining power. The court also noted that forfeiture of earnest money could only occur after giving the opposite party an opportunity to show cause, in line with principles of natural justice.Regarding the assessment of damages, the court ruled that damages under Section 73 of the Indian Contract Act should arise naturally from a breach of contractual terms and be direct and foreseeable. NJMC failed to provide reasonable evidence of damages, and its claims were characterized as speculative and remote \u201cguesstimates.\u201dIn conclusion, the court directed NJMC to quash its order withholding the petitioner\u2019s pre-bid earnest money and to refund it within three weeks of the judgment.Case: Sushil Kumar Thard V. National Jute Manufactures Corporation Limited & Ors.", "Allahabad HC: Lacks expertise to determine Ethephon qualifies as exemption under Insecticide Act": "LI NetworkPublished on: 01 October 2023 at 12:24 ISTThe Allahabad High Court recently ruled that it lacks the expertise to determine whether Ethephon, an insecticide, qualifies for exemption under Section 38(1)(b) of the Insecticide Act, 1968. While acknowledging that the petitioner failed to prove the validity of their exemption claim, the court directed the petitioner to present their case before the statutory authority, which possesses the necessary fact-finding capabilities to decide the matter.A bench consisting of Justices Saumitra Dayal Singh and Rajendra Kumar-IV emphasized the need for a factual inquiry to determine the validity of the petitioner\u2019s claim. They stated that this consideration became necessary due to the exemption asserted by the petitioner, which must be evaluated and tested by the fact-finding authority, i.e., the statutory authorities.BackgroundThe petitioner is engaged in the business of importing, manufacturing, and trading in Ethylene Ripener/Ethephon. They import bulk quantities of Ethylene Ripener/Ethephon from China and repackage them into smaller units. Some of these goods were imported, and customs duty was paid on them. However, a search operation was conducted at the petitioner\u2019s premises, leading to the detention of Ethylene Ripener/Ethephon, Ethylene Ripener (Mango), and Ethylene Ripener (Banana) under Section 110 of the Customs Act, 1969.The petitioner challenged the detention memo and the search and seizure proceedings during the pendency of a writ petition. Notably, a seizure order was issued at this stage, which was contested through an amendment application. Currently, a show cause notice under Section 124 of the Act has been issued to the petitioner, and confiscation proceedings are pending.The petitioner\u2019s counsel argued that under Section 110 read with Section 111(d) of the Act, only goods subject to prohibition under the Act or any other applicable law may be seized or confiscated if they were imported in violation of such prohibition. It was contended that the petitioner\u2019s goods were not prohibited goods. Additionally, they invoked Section 38(1)(b) of the Insecticide Act, asserting that Ethephon qualifies for exemption as it is a ripening agent and is not regulated by the Insecticide Act, 1968, since it is not used to prevent, mitigate, repel, or destroy any plant or animal life.The petitioner also argued that Section 11(3) of the Act stipulates that any prohibition under another law can only be executed under the Customs Act if a notification to that effect has been issued under the Customs Act. The petitioner maintained that no such notification had been issued in their case, rendering the entire proceedings by the Department jurisdictionally flawed.The revenue department defended the proceedings, citing Section 17 of the Insecticide Act, which prohibits the import or manufacture of certain insecticides without registration under the Act. They contended that the petitioner had not obtained registration under the Insecticide Act to import Ethephon, making it prohibited under the Customs Act. The department also referred to Section 2(33) of the Customs Act to classify Ethephon as prohibited goods.High Court\u2019s VerdictThe court determined that Ethephon is a scheduled commodity under the Insecticide Act, and registration under the Act is mandatory for its import. Examining Section 38(1)(b) of the Insecticide Act, the court noted that the legislative intent was clear in allowing exemptions for insecticides used in households, kitchen gardens, and agriculture, provided they do not harm life forms perceived as not beneficial to humans.However, the court concluded that it lacks the expertise in chemistry or the environment to determine whether the import or manufacture of Ethephon may prevent, destroy, repel, or mitigate any form of plant or animal life. As a result, the court held that the matter should be adjudicated by a fact-finding authority.Referring to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Commissioner of Income Tax, Madras vs. R. Venkataswamy Naidu, the court emphasized that the burden of establishing an exemption rests with the person making the claim. Thus, the petitioner could not claim an exemption for Ethephon without providing proof of its exemption under the Act.The court also clarified that Section 11(3) of the Act, though inserted, had not been enforced through a notification and therefore would not apply. However, it noted that Section 110 read with Section 111(d) and 2(33) of the Customs Act, as well as Section 9 and 17 of the Insecticide Act, empower authorities to seize Ethephon for the lack of a registration certificate under the Insecticide Act.Consequently, the writ petition was disposed of with a directive for the petitioner to respond to the show cause notice.Case Title: M/S Gold Ripe International Private Limited v. Directorate Of Revenue Intelligence And 4 Others", "Supreme Court: Hospital Bears Burden of Proof in Cases of Evident Medical Negligence": "LI NetworkPublished on: 01 October 2023 at 12:15 ISTThe Supreme Court reaffirmed the application of the legal principle known as \u201cres ipsa loquitur\u201d in the context of medical negligence cases. This principle, which means \u201cthe thing speaks for itself,\u201d places the burden of proof on the hospital or medical practitioners when negligence is apparent.The Supreme Court upheld this principle while awarding Rs 1.5 crore in compensation to a former Indian Air Force official who contracted HIV during a blood transfusion at a military hospital.Also Read: What is Medico-Legal work? What is the procedure to be followed? The court determined that the appellant\u2019s condition was a direct consequence of the negligence displayed by the two hospital establishments, which resulted in the transfusion of HIV-positive infected blood. The foundational facts necessary to apply res ipsa loquitur were convincingly proven, and the respondents failed to demonstrate that they exercised due care and complied with the relevant standards. Consequently, the court held the respondents liable for compensating the appellant for his injuries.Both the Indian Army and the Indian Air Force were jointly and severally held accountable for medical negligence in this case.The bench, consisting of Justices S. Ravindra Bhat and Dipankar Datta, heard an appeal against a judgment by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) that denied the compensation sought by the Air Veteran.The Court began by citing Charlesworth & Percy on Negligence (14th Ed. 2018) to define res ipsa loquitur as a case that \u201ccalls for some answer from the defendant and will arise upon proof of:1. The occurrence of an unexplained event;2. An event that would not have happened in the ordinary course of things without negligence by someone other than the claimant; and3. Circumstances that indicate the defendant\u2019s negligence rather than that of any other party.\u201dThe Court referred to several prior judgments, including V. Kishan Rao v Nikhil Super Speciality Hospital (2010), which emphasized that when negligence is evident, \u201cthe principle of res ipsa loquitur applies, and the complainant does not need to prove anything as the situation itself speaks for negligence.\u201d In such cases, it becomes the responsibility of the respondent to demonstrate that they have exercised due care and fulfilled their duty to refute the charge of negligence.The Court emphasized the importance of applying the principle of res ipsa loquitur in medical negligence cases, citing the Nizam Institute of Medical Sciences case (2009). It stated that once the complainant has demonstrated negligence on the part of the hospital or doctors, the burden shifts to the hospital or attending doctors to prove the absence of negligence.Additionally, the Court referred to the Savita Garg case (2004), which established that once evidence is presented indicating that a patient suffered due to a lack of care, the burden shifts to the hospital to justify the absence of negligence.However, the Court cautioned against relying solely on res ipsa loquitur to assign liability, as highlighted in the cases of Martin F. D\u2019Souza (2009) and Bombay Hospital and Medical Research Centre v Asha Jaiswal 2021. In Asha Jaiswal\u2019s case, the court clarified that \u201cthe maxim res ipsa loquitur does not require the raising of any presumption of law shifting the burden to the defendant. It merely allows the drawing of a permissive inference of fact based on the circumstances of the accident.\u201dIn conclusion, the court held the respondents liable to compensate the appellant for his injuries, which would be determined in monetary terms.", "Orissa HC Upholds Faith: ASI and Temple Committee Join Forces for Ratna Bhandar Conservation": "LI NetworkPublished on: 01 October 2023 at 11:53 ISTThe Orissa High Court has issued a directive for collaboration between the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) and the managing committee of the Jagannath Temple in Puri regarding the conservation work of the Ratna Bhandar, the temple\u2019s treasury. The ruling came in response to a petition filed by BJP leader Samir Mohanty. The Court, while refusing to interfere in the matter, cited the Supreme Court\u2019s 2019 observation that the Shri Jagannath Temple Managing Committee (SJTMC) is the sole repository of faith. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice S. Talapatra and Justice Savitri Ratho emphasized the importance of the temple as a symbol of faith for millions of people.The petitioner, Samir Mohanty, raised concerns about the safety of the Ratna Bhandar and transparency regarding the valuable articles stored within it. The High Court, acknowledging the significance of these concerns, directed the State Government to form a High-Level Committee within sixty days of SJTMC\u2019s approach. This committee would assist SJTMC in the process of inventorying the valuables, including jewelry, stored in the Ratna Bhandar. The Court also emphasized that if the SJTMC seeks cooperation from the state government, it should actively participate in efficient management.The Court referred to a meeting held in August between ASI and SJTMC, where detailed discussions regarding the conservation and repair of Ratna Bhandar, as well as a fresh inventory of valuables, took place. It was decided in the meeting that Ratna Bhandar would be opened and repaired during the next Rath Yatra. The Court dismissed the petitioner\u2019s request for immediate intervention and stated that a high-level committee, led by a retired high court or Supreme Court judge, would supervise the inventory process if SJTMC approaches the state government for cooperation.This directive underscores the temple\u2019s central role in the faith of millions and highlights the collaborative efforts being made to ensure the preservation of its historical and religious treasures.", "CBSE Defends Localized Education, Countering Plea for Uniform Syllabus Across Boards": "LI NetworkPublished on: 30 September 2023 at 22:40 ISTThe Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has staunchly opposed a petition requesting a uniform syllabus and curriculum in mother language across CBSE, ICSE, and State Boards. The Joint Secretary (A&L) acting on behalf of CBSE filed a counter affidavit challenging the plea, emphasizing that a uniform curriculum cannot disregard the local context, culture, and language.In their response, CBSE highlighted that education falls within the Concurrent List of the Constitution of India, allowing State and Union Territory Governments the authority to design syllabi, curricula, and conduct examinations for their schools. The National Curriculum Framework (NCF) developed by the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) provides the guidelines for syllabus and textbook development at all school stages.The affidavit clarified that NCERT, as the academic authority under the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 (RTE Act), prepares the national curriculum framework. States can either adopt NCERT\u2019s model syllabi or develop their own based on the NCF. CBSE asserted that the diverse educational landscape in India requires flexibility, allowing for the integration of local resources, culture, and ethos into the learning process.The petitioner, Advocate Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay, had argued for a standardized syllabus across various competitive exams. Upadhyay contended that the current disparities in syllabus create unequal opportunities for students, especially in government schools, and burden parents with additional expenses for coaching centers. The plea advocated for a One Nation-One Education Board system and the implementation of NCERT books in all schools.Also Read: Right to Education in India\u2013 A Long Road to go \u2013 Law Insider India Case Title:  Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay v.

The exporters had contested the notice, citing an unreasonable delay in its adjudication, a plea that the court found valid.The Division Bench, comprising Justice Vibhu Bakhru and Justice Amit Mahajan, noted that the DRI had not made a reasonable effort to adjudicate the notice during this extended period. The High Court stated that the controversy was resolved by its earlier ruling in the case of Swatch Group India Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors, emphasizing that the time allocated for adjudicating the notice had long passed.The case dated back to the years 2000-2005 when the exporters were involved in exporting readymade garments and leather goods to Russian and international customers under various schemes.The DRI had issued a show cause notice based on intelligence suggesting fraudulent exports by certain Indian companies. Allegedly, these companies were exploiting export incentives, including drawback benefits, through inflated invoices and diversion of goods. Despite the notice, no effective steps were taken for its adjudication from April 3, 2009, to July 21, 2016. The court found no valid justifications for this delay and set aside the DRI\u2019s attempt to recommence the adjudication proceedings.The ruling implies that once the stipulated period for adjudication elapses, authorities such as the DRI cannot proceed with the adjudication of the show cause notice. This verdict serves as a precedent, emphasizing the necessity of timely adjudication and preventing undue harassment of businesses due to prolonged legal processes.The case was titled Gala International Pvt Ltd and Ors. v.

The 33-year-old doctor, employed at a private hospital, has committed to dedicating one day each month for the next six months to serve in a government hospital, subject to obtaining the necessary permissions.The contempt of court proceedings were initiated by the High Court itself against the doctor due to her non-compliance with a court order in a matrimonial and child custody dispute.The High Court, upon acknowledging the doctor\u2019s apology, stated, \u201cThe learned counsel for the respondent/accused submits that his client is tendering her unconditional apology and assures this court that in the future, she would act in such a way that there would be no occasion for initiation of any action against her. To show her bona fides, she assures to engage herself a day of every calendar month in community services for six months in any government hospital of Bengaluru City with prior permission from its HOD, Civil Surgeon or the Director, as the case may be.\u201dThe court also directed government hospitals to consider her request for community service. It further clarified that her commitment and assurance would be treated as an undertaking, and she would be granted permission to engage in community service for one full day each month in a government hospital for the next six months.The contempt proceedings against the doctor were initiated for her alleged interference and obstruction of the administration of justice. Earlier this year, the High Court had granted custody of the couple\u2019s minor child to the father. However, the doctor did not comply with the court\u2019s order to transfer custody.As a result, the High Court issued a notice to her in the contempt proceedings, which led to her submission of an affidavit in September and her personal appearance in court.

On September 15, the Supreme Court decided to establish a search committee to oversee the selection of vice-chancellors, considering the contentious nature of the issue.The court requested independent recommendations from the governor, the state government, and the University Grants Commission (UGC), each suggesting three to five names. Subsequently, the court will nominate some of these individuals to serve on the search committee.A bench consisting of Justices Surya Kant and Dipankar Datta addressed the matter on September 27, noting that the involved parties had agreed to provide detailed information about the universities, the subjects taught, existing appointment provisions for Search Committee members, and any new provisions proposed in pending legislation awaiting the governor\u2019s approval.The bench also granted intervenors and others the liberty to propose the names of distinguished scientists, technocrats, administrators, educationists, jurists, or other eminent figures for consideration as potential members of the Search Committee.The court instructed all parties to complete the submission of details and names by Wednesday, scheduling a hearing for the state government\u2019s plea on October 6.The Supreme Court\u2019s involvement in this matter stemmed from the West Bengal government\u2019s appeal against the Calcutta High Court\u2019s June 28 ruling, which upheld the legality of the governor\u2019s orders appointing interim vice-chancellors in 11 state-run universities, as he serves as the ex-officio chancellor of these institutions.A contentious dispute between the Mamata Banerjee-led government and Governor C V Ananda Bose has emerged over the governance and administration of the state\u2019s universities.The Supreme Court acknowledged that the state government\u2019s bill regarding the appointment of vice-chancellors was awaiting the governor\u2019s approval. Consequently, the court decided to establish its own search committee to select vice-chancellors.Advocate Subhasish Bhowmick, representing the governor\u2019s office, noted that the court had directed the governor, the state government, and the University Grants Commission to submit three to five names for the bench\u2019s consideration by September 25.Previously, the high court had affirmed that the chancellor possessed the authority to appoint vice-chancellors in accordance with relevant statutes.Sanat Kumar Ghosh, a petitioner in the case, argued that the appointments of vice-chancellors to state-run universities were illegal, as the higher education department had not been consulted by Governor Bose prior to these appointments.The petitioner asserted that the chancellor, contrary to the proposal presented by the higher education minister, had made a series of vice-chancellor appointments without consulting him.The high court contended that, as the final decision rested with the governor, who is the appointing authority for vice-chancellors, the manner and method of consultation should be left to his discretion, and the consultee could not dictate the terms of consultation to the chancellor. Among the universities affected by the appointment of interim vice-chancellors on June 1 were the University of Calcutta, University of Kalyani, and Jadavpur University.", "Delhi High Court Restrains Entities Distributing Apna College\u2019s Copyrighted Material on Social Media": "LI NetworkPublished on: 30 September 2023 at 14:02 ISTThe Delhi High Court, presided over by Justice Prathiba M Singh, has issued a restraining order against several entities involved in the distribution and sharing of educational course materials from the online platform \u201cApna College\u201d on social media channels such as WhatsApp, Telegram, and YouTube.This legal action stemmed from a suit filed by Apna College, alleging copyright infringement against 17 defendant entities who were found to be disseminating Apna College\u2019s educational content, including printed course materials and videos, across various social media platforms.Apna College contended that its copyrighted course materials, known as ALPHA, DELTA, and ALPHA PLUS, encompassed recorded videos, live sessions, recordings of live sessions, assignment questions, reading materials, and question banks.In response to this infringement, Justice Singh issued an interim injunction order, instructing that the details of the Telegram channels or handles, as outlined in the complaint, be provided to the respective social media platform, with a mandate to block them within a span of 72 hours.Furthermore, the court ordered Telegram to disclose any available information regarding the individuals or entities responsible for operating these channels, including email addresses and phone numbers. These disclosed details would be solely utilized for the ongoing lawsuit, and not for any other purposes, as stipulated by the court.Justice Singh also directed that any newly emerging Telegram channels or backup channels related to the case must promptly share their information with Telegram, which would then take appropriate actions accordingly.In making these determinations, Justice Singh drew upon a precedent set by her in a previous case, Neetu Singh v. Telegram FZ LLC, which involved unauthorized sharing of video lectures, books, and educational materials on the Telegram platform.The court noted that in the current case, the defendant entities had employed various methods to communicate and circulate Apna College\u2019s courses, videos, and course materials without authorization.Additionally, the court ordered Google LLC to remove the YouTube channel \u2018Show Time,\u2019 which contained copyrighted works infringing upon Apna College\u2019s content. It also mandated the suspension of several domain names, including www.hacktack.com, www.classcentral.com, and www.freecourseuniverse.com.Furthermore, Justice Singh directed the deactivation of WhatsApp numbers belonging to two individuals who were illicitly sharing Apna College\u2019s lectures and PDF questions through the application. The court also ordered the disbandment of the WhatsApp group \u2018JAVA Alpha Placement Batch,\u2019 created by an individual.Lastly, Mediafire, a file hosting application, was instructed to remove the file-sharing link that contained infringing content from Apna College.The court acknowledged the ease of copying and reproducing course materials on digital platforms and noted that these defendant entities had amassed a substantial number of subscribers. They were also found to be collecting substantial sums of money for the unauthorized distribution of copyrighted materials belonging to Apna College.The court emphasized that these entities were luring students and candidates to subscribe to their channels as an alternative to paying Apna College\u2019s fees. Failure to block these defendants from disseminating Apna College\u2019s copyrighted material would result in significant financial losses and damage to the platform\u2019s reputation. Thus, the court concluded that the injunction was warranted to prevent further unauthorized dissemination of Apna College\u2019s copyrighted material.Also Read: The Copyright Act \u2013 Ownership and Infringement ", "Gauhati HC Questions Need for Separate Prayer Room at Guwahati Airport for One Community in PIL": "LI NetworkPublished on: 30 September 2023 at 12:50 ISTThe Gauhati High Court raised significant concerns regarding a recent public interest litigation (PIL) that requested the establishment of a separate prayer room for Muslims at Guwahati Airport. In the case of Rana Saidur Zaman v. Union of India and others, a Bench comprising Chief Justice Sandeep Mehta and Justice Susmita Phukan Khaund questioned the petitioner, who appeared without legal representation, about the potential public harm prevented by constructing a separate prayer room.The judges inquired whether any fundamental rights would be violated by not creating such prayer rooms and stressed that India is a secular country, questioning the need for a prayer room for a specific community. The Chief Justice pointed out that designated spaces are available outside the airport for those who wish to pray.\u00a0The petitioner argued that some flights are scheduled during Muslim prayer times, to which the Chief Justice responded that individuals can choose flights that align with their prayer times, as airports offer such options. The petitioner noted that the Airports Authority of India rules address commercial establishments but not prayer rooms, to which the Chief Justice emphasized that prayer is not a commercial activity but a religious sentiment.The petitioner questioned why Guwahati Airport lacks a prayer room when other airports like Delhi, Thiruvananthapuram, and Agartala have them. The Chief Justice countered by asking whether it constitutes a fundamental right and violation. He further questioned why only airports were being addressed and not all public institutions, suggesting that citizens can utilize places of worship for their religious needs.The petitioner argued that airports can designate spaces for prayer rooms, similar to smoking rooms. The Chief Justice clarified that smoking rooms are meant to prevent harm to public health from smoking, making them a different case.Ultimately, the Court declined to issue notice in the matter but granted the petitioner two weeks to provide relevant judgments and legal provisions in his favor, if any, after observing that he was not adequately prepared.", "Gujarat University Accuses Arvind Kejriwal of Prolonging Modi\u2019s Degree stating it serve no Legitimate purpose": "LI NetworkPublished on: 30 September 2023 at 12:44 ISTThe Gujarat University has accused Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal of deliberately prolonging the controversy surrounding Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s academic degree, stating that Kejriwal\u2019s actions serve no legitimate purpose. This argument was presented by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta on behalf of Gujarat University during a review application hearing in the Gujarat High Court, presided over by Justice Biren Vaishnav.The review application, filed by Kejriwal, pertains to a March 31, 2023 judgment in which the High Court had nullified a Chief Information Commission (CIC) order. The CIC had directed Gujarat University to disclose details of PM Modi\u2019s degree in response to a Right to Information (RTI) Act application submitted by Kejriwal. Additionally, the High Court had imposed a fine of \u20b925,000 on Kejriwal for allegedly ridiculing the RTI Act.In opposition to the review plea, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing Gujarat University, argued that Kejriwal\u2019s intent was to sustain an unnecessary controversy. Mehta emphasized that the university could not reveal personal information unless it was determined that doing so was in the public interest.Mehta also justified the High Court\u2019s previous findings and the imposed fine, asserting that Kejriwal had misused the RTI Act. He argued that the Prime Minister\u2019s degree had no bearing on his public office, and the CIC\u2019s order had been needlessly politicized.Furthermore, Mehta stated that the university was not legally obligated to disclose the Prime Minister\u2019s degree and requested that the Court impose costs on Kejriwal for pursuing the review application.In response, Senior Advocate Percy Kavina, representing Kejriwal, criticized Mehta\u2019s stance as an attempt to suppress legal dissent. Kavina argued that the Court had made unwarranted observations, particularly those characterizing Kejriwal\u2019s conduct as reprehensible. He clarified that Kejriwal had not provoked the Court\u2019s censure and had instead sought a swift resolution to the matter.Regarding the Court\u2019s assertion that disclosing the Prime Minister\u2019s degree was unrelated to \u201clarger public interest,\u201d Kavina contended that this finding lacked factual basis.Regarding the university\u2019s claim that the degree was available on its official website, Kavina asserted that this assertion was inaccurate and that the degree was not accessible online.Following these arguments, the Bench reserved its judgment on the case.", "Delhi HC Clarifies and Finalizes Settlement Terms in Theos vs. Theobroma Trademark Infringement Suit": "LI NetworkPublished on: 30 September 2023 at 12:32 ISTThe Delhi High Court has provided clarifications and finalized the settlement terms in the trademark infringement dispute between confectionery brands Theos and Theobroma, known as Theos Food Pvt Ltd & Ors v.

The clarifications were issued by Justice Prathiba M Singh after both parties informed the Court that they were unable to reach a settlement based on the guidelines previously issued by the Court in July 2022.The dispute originated from a lawsuit filed by Theos, seeking to prohibit Theobroma from using the mark \u2018THEOS\u2019 as a prefix for various food items sold in its outlets. Initially, the parties expressed their willingness to settle the dispute mutually, and the Court provided guidelines in July 2022 to facilitate the settlement. As part of these guidelines, Theos agreed to limit its services for goods bearing the \u2018THEOS\u2019 mark to the Delhi-NCR region.However, due to ongoing disagreements, both parties repeatedly requested adjournments, ultimately informing the Court that a settlement could not be reached. Consequently, they proposed that the suit could be decreed or disposed of in accordance with the July 2022 order, with some clarifications regarding pending disputes.The Court ruled on four specific areas of clarification:1. Use of the mark \u2018THEOS\u2019: Theos argued that Theobroma had registered only the mark \u2018THEO\u2019 and should not use \u2018THEOS.\u2019 Theobroma claimed they had used \u2018THEOS\u2019 for several years. The Court clarified that Theobroma could use \u2018THEOS\u2019 for five specific products, as outlined in the previous order.2. Geographical limitation: Theos expressed concern about enforcing its trademark rights outside Delhi-NCR due to the regional restriction. The Court clarified that this restriction would not affect Theos\u2019s rights to seek injunctions against the misuse of identical or similar marks.3. Limitation by Nice classification: Theos argued that Theobroma\u2019s registration of the \u2018THEO\u2019 mark should be restricted to class 30 (foodstuffs) and not extended to other classes. The Court clarified that the use of the mark would be limited to the five specified products, regardless of class.4. QR menu card: Theobroma requested permission to use the \u2018THEO\u2019 mark on physical and QR code menus. Theos agreed to this as long as it was limited to menus in physical outlets only.Based on these terms, the Court decreed and disposed of the suit.", "RPF Members Eligible for Compensation under Employees Compensation Act Despite Armed Force Status: Supreme Court": "LI NetworkPublished on: 30 September 2023 at 11:07 ISTThe Supreme Court affirmed that officers of the Railway Protection Force (RPF) can seek compensation under the Employees Compensation Act, 1923, even though the RPF has been designated as an armed force of the Union.A bench comprising Justice B.V. Nagarathna and Justice Manoj Misra held that despite the declaration of the RPF as an armed force of the Union, legislative intent did not aim to exclude its members or their heirs from the compensation benefits payable under the 1923 Act or the 1989 Act.The case in question revolved around the husband of the respondent, who served as a Constable in the RPF and tragically lost his life in a work-related accident in 2008. The deceased\u2019s heirs sought compensation under the 1923 Act, a claim opposed by the appellant on the grounds that the deceased was a part of the Armed Forces of the Union and, therefore, not a \u201cworkman\u201d under the 1923 Act.Before the Supreme Court, the appellant argued that due to Section 3 of the Railway Protection Force Act, 1957, the deceased was considered part of the Armed Forces of the Union. Since Section 2 of the 1923 Act excludes individuals working as members of the Armed Forces of the Union from the definition of \u2018workman,\u2018 the appellant contended that the heirs were not entitled to compensation under the Act. However, the Supreme Court did not concur with the appellant\u2019s position.The Supreme Court observed that the term \u201carmed forces of the Union\u201d came into effect on January 26, 1950, to replace the words \u201cHis Majesty\u2019s naval, military or air forces,\u201d as per the \u201cAdaptation of Laws Order, 1950\u201d issued by the President under Article 372(2) of the Constitution. This change was made to align with the Indian Constitution. The Court emphasized that a mere declaration of this nature would not remove the benefits of the 1923 Act from RPF officers unless such legislative intent was explicitly demonstrated.The Court stated, \u201cIndisputably, the 1923 Act is a pre-independence statute; therefore, on India being declared a Republic by our Constitution, the use of the phrase \u2018His Majesty\u2019s naval, military or air forces\u2019 appearing therein became antithetical to our Constitution. Hence, to make it in accord with our Constitution, it was considered necessary to substitute the said phrase with the phrase \u2018armed forces of the Union.\u2019 However, neither the Constitution of India (see Article 366) nor The General Clauses Act, 1897 or the 1923 Act defines \u2018armed forces of the Union.\u2019 Therefore, in our view, mere declaration in Section 3 of the 1957 Act that the RPF shall be an \u2018armed force of the Union\u2019 is not sufficient to take it out of the purview of the 1923 Act.\u201dThe Court emphasized that the legislative intent was crucial. In other words, the Court sought to determine whether, by declaring an RPF member as a member of the armed forces of the Union, the legislature intended to deprive them of benefits they would otherwise receive as railway servants under the 1989 Act.The Court concluded that despite designating the RPF as an armed force of the Union, the legislative intent did not intend to exclude RPF officers from the purview of the 1923 Act. Since the definition of a \u2018Railway Servant\u2019 includes RPF members under the Railways Act, 1989, and since railway servants continue to be considered workmen as per Section 2 of the 1923 Act, its provisions are applicable to RPF members. Additionally, Section 128 of the Railways Act clarifies that the right to claim compensation under the 1989 Act does not affect the right to recover compensation under the 1923 Act.The Court noted that Section 19 of the Railway Protection Force Act, 1957, as amended in 1985, and Section 3 of the Act designating the RPF as a Union armed force did not incorporate provisions to exempt the applicability of the 1923 Act. The amendments explicitly categorized every RPF member as a railway employee for all purposes except under Chapter VIA of the Indian Railways Act, 1890, pertaining to duty hours and similar matters.Therefore, despite Section 19 of the 1957 Act declaring that certain other labor laws do not apply to RPF members, there was no exclusion of the applicability of the provisions of the 1923 Act.In light of these considerations, the Supreme Court concluded that the legislature did not intend to deny compensation benefits to RPF officers under the Employees Compensation Act, 1923. Consequently, the appeal was dismissed.Case Title: Commanding Officer, Railway Protection Special Force, Mumbai V. Bhavnaben Dinshbhai Bhabhor", "Supreme Court Places Onus on Tenant to Prove Premises Leased for Manufacturing Purpose": "LI NetworkPublished on: 30 September 2023 at 10:45 ISTThe Supreme Court, with a bench comprising Justice Aniruddha Bose and Justice Vikram Nath, has ruled that to trigger the provisions of Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, which necessitates a six-month notice for the termination of a lease, the tenant must demonstrate that manufacturing activities were indeed conducted in the leased premises. A mere assertion that manufacturing activities occurred is insufficient; the tenant must elucidate the nature of the work performed in the factory shed.Background:In 2003, a landlady and a tenant entered into an unregistered tenancy agreement for a property (\u201cPremises\u201d) for a five-year period. After five years, the tenancy agreement was not renewed, but the tenant continued to occupy the premises without paying rent. In 2008, the landlady issued a notice to the tenant (addressing him as a monthly tenant) instructing him to vacate the premises within 15 days, a demand that the tenant failed to meet.Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 (\u201cTP Act\u201d) stipulates that in the absence of a contract, a lease of immovable property for agricultural or manufacturing purposes shall be considered a year-to-year lease, terminable by either the lessor or lessee with six months\u2019 notice. It further specifies that a lease of immovable property for any other purpose is regarded as a month-to-month lease, terminable with fifteen days\u2019 notice by either party.Section 107 of the TP Act states that a lease of immovable property for a year or more, or one reserving an annual rent, can only be made through a registered instrument.Section 17 of the Registration Act, 1908, lists documents that must be registered, including documents in which immovable property is leased for a term exceeding one year. Section 49 of the Registration Act stipulates that an unregistered document, which is otherwise subject to compulsory registration, cannot be admitted as evidence in court.When the tenant failed to vacate the premises, the landlady filed a civil suit seeking possession and a decree for mesne profits. During cross-examination, Defense Witness DW-1 stated that he was engaged in the rubber business.The tenant argued that the premises were leased for manufacturing purposes, and therefore, as per Section 106 of the TP Act, termination required a six-month notice. Additionally, the lease agreement exceeded one year, requiring compulsory registration. Since it was unregistered, it could not be admitted as evidence in court, rendering the suit unsustainable.The trial court ruled that the lease was month-to-month and governed by the TP Act, and it was not for manufacturing purposes. Consequently, a fifteen-day notice was valid, and the suit was maintainable. The judgment favored the landlady.On appeal, the High Court\u2019s division bench upheld the trial court\u2019s decision. The tenant then appealed to the Supreme Court.Supreme Court Verdict:The bench noted that the tenancy agreement in question was subject to compulsory registration under Section 17 of the Registration Act, as the agreement specified a five-year term.The primary issue revolved around the \u2018nature and character of possession.\u2019 To invoke Section 106 of the TP Act, which mandates a six-month notice for vacating the property, it had to be established whether the premises were leased for manufacturing purposes.In Allenbury Engineers Pvt. Ltd. v. Ramkrishna Dalmia and Ors, (1973), the term \u2018manufacturing purpose\u2018 was defined as \u201cpurposes for making or fabricating articles or materials through physical labor, skill, or mechanical power, for sale and use as such. Manufacturing or fabricating involves more than merely altering an existing article or material; it entails transforming it into a distinct article or material with a unique name, character, or use, or creating a previously known article using an innovative process.\u201dThe bench observed that the premises were leased to the tenant \u201cfor the purpose of his business and/or factory.\u201d The premises included a factory with a shed/godown area. However, such a description alone was insufficient to establish that the lease was intended for manufacturing purposes.The decision in Park Street Properties Private Limited v. Dipak Kumar Singh and Anr., (2016)  was cited, which stated that in the absence of a registered instrument, courts were not precluded from determining tenancy based on other evidence and the purpose of the tenancy.The bench maintained that the existence of a tenancy was established, but it was impossible to establish the purpose of the tenancy to trigger the six-month notice requirement under Section 106 of the TP Act based on such evidence, where registration of the deed would have been mandatory.\u201cIn this case, the fact of the creation of a tenancy has been established. But the purpose of the tenancy, so as to trigger the six months\u2019 notice period under Section 106 of the 1882 Act, cannot be established by such evidence, as in such a situation, the registration of the deed would have been mandatory.\u201dFurthermore, the onus is on the defendant to prove that manufacturing activities were carried out on the premises by explaining the nature of the work conducted in the factory shed. A mere statement that manufacturing activities took place is insufficient.\u201cThe burden would fall on the defendant to establish the fact that manufacturing activities were carried out on the demised premises. A mere statement by DW-1, as referenced earlier, or the purpose of the lease as specified in the leaseagreement would not be enough to demonstrate that the lease was for manufacturing purposes. This could be proven by explaining the type of work conducted in the factory shed. In such a scenario, registration of the deed would also have been necessary. In the absence of such registration, the tenancy would be of a \u2018month-to-month\u2019 nature. For these reasons, we do not believe that the High Court erred in dismissing the defendant\u2019s appeal.\u201dThe court concluded that the tenant failed to prove that the premises were leased for manufacturing purposes. As a result, the 15-day notice issued by the landlady was valid. The Supreme Court upheld the High Court\u2019s decision and dismissed the appeal.Also From the Judgment: When Can an Unregistered Lease Deed, Which Is Compulsorily Registrable, Be Admitted to Show the Nature and Character of Possession? Supreme Court ExplainsCase Title: M/S Paul Rubber Industries Private Limited V. Amit Chand Mitra & Anr.", "Rajasthan HC Limits Post-Retirement Disciplinary Inquiry Punishment while Overturning 5% Pension Deduction": "LI NetworkPublished on: 30 September 2023 at 10:32 ISTThe Rajasthan High Court in Jaipur has emphasized that the scope of punishment in a disciplinary inquiry completed after retirement is quite limited. Consequently, the court overturned a penalty order that imposed a 5% deduction from the petitioner\u2019s pension, reasoning that the petitioner\u2019s actions did not amount to serious misconduct warranting such a penalty.Justice Anoop Kumar Dhand pointed out that, according to Rule 7 of the Rajasthan Civil Service (Pension) Rules, withholding pension or any portion of it can only occur when a pensioner is found guilty of grave misconduct committed during their service tenure.The Court heard a case brought by a retired Inspector General (Prison) challenging a penalty order issued by the State, which imposed a 5% deduction from his pension for two years.The petitioner contended that he retired on June 30, 1991, and, on the day before his retirement, he received a charge sheet under Rule 16 of the Rajasthan Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules (CCA Rules) for an incident that occurred in 1977.The incident concerned two jail guards who had been convicted in a criminal case and granted probation. It was alleged that the petitioner misused his authority by revoking the suspension orders of these jail guards, leaving it to the Government to take action against them.The State argued that the petitioner had acted maliciously to protect these jail guards, justifying the charge sheet. The State also argued that a thorough inquiry had been conducted before issuing the penalty order.However, the petitioner argued that he had forwarded the matter to the competent authority, which did not take any action against the jail guards. He contended that the authorities had been aware of the incident since 1977, and he should not be held responsible for their inaction.The Court found the State\u2019s actions arbitrary, as it had failed to take action against the petitioner for over 14 years and issued a charge sheet against him just before his retirement.The Court questioned why no disciplinary action was taken against the petitioner for such a long time and why the charge sheet was issued on June 29, 1991, the day before his retirement on June 30, 1991. It deemed the State\u2019s actions arbitrary.The Court further noted that when no action was taken against the two jail guards under Rule 19, so there was no reason to serve a charge sheet for these charges against the petitioner on the eve of his retirement.The Court concluded that the charge sheet was served malafidely and in an arbitrary manner after a lapse of 14 years, and it caused severe prejudice to the petitioner. The disciplinary inquiry against the petitioner had taken 8 years to complete, and there was no explanation for such a lengthy delay.Therefore, the Court ruled that the impugned order was not legally sustainable and should be quashed and set aside.As a result, the Court directed the State to refund any deducted amount from the petitioner\u2019s pension, if applicable, to the petitioner\u2019s legal representatives within three months, with an interest rate of 9% per annum.Case Title: Ramanuj Sharma v. State of Rajasthan", "[Landmark Judgement] Mohinder Singh V. State of Punjab (2018)": "Published on: 30 September 2023 at 10:32 ISTCourt: Supreme Court of IndiaCitation: Mohinder Singh V. State of Punjab (2018)\u00a0Honourable Supreme Court of India has held that Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (NDPS Act) is a presumptive legislation and thus, the interpretation of the said Act has to be strict. It is held that the defective investigation would require for the interest of justice which would benefit in the acquittal.3. We have serious reservations with regard to the selective act of the State in challenging the appellant\u2019s acquittal alone. If that was not enough, the conviction is based on a defective investigation. No investigation was conducted with regard to the origin and destination of the contraband. The owner of the truck was also not proceeded against under Section 25 of the NDPS Act. No proceedings for confiscation of the truck were taken. The only independent witness was disbelieved and was held to be a stock police witness by the trial court.

Instead, the Commission has suggested granting judicial discretion to courts to impose sentences less severe than the minimum prescribed when the child is 16 years or older and the age difference between the individuals involved is not more than 3 years.Also Read: What is POCSO Act, 2012? Additionally, the Commission has recommended amendments to the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act 2015, enabling the Juvenile Justice Board to handle cases under the POCSO Act where both parties are between 16 and 18 years of age, rather than criminal courts.The suggested changes to Section 18 of the JJ Act empower the JJ Board to dispose of such cases by awarding sentences other than imprisonment, such as admonishment, community service, counseling, or release on probation, subject to good conduct.The Commission has identified two main categories of cases: those involving adolescents aged 16 to 18 years on both sides and those involving one party aged 16 to 18 years and the other party as an adult. While the first category is recommended to be handled under the JJ Act, the Commission has advised caution regarding the second category, suggesting that these cases be dealt with by Special Courts with the authority to exercise judicial discretion and consider the specific circumstances when imposing sentences.Amendments Proposed to the POCSO Act:The report proposes certain amendments to the POCSO Act in cases of tacit consensual sex involving children aged 16 to 18. In such cases, the Commission recommends not treating them with the same severity as cases that clearly fall under the POCSO Act. Although the Commission advises against lowering the age of consent, it recommends introducing \u2018guided judicial discretion\u2019 in sentencing for cases involving tacit consent.The Commission has emphasized that lowering the age of consent is not advisable, stating, \u201cAfter a careful review of existing child protection laws, various judgments, and considering the maladies of child abuse, child trafficking, and child prostitution that plague our society, the Commission is of the measured view that it is not advisable to tinker with the existing age of consent under the POCSO Act.\u201dFactors to Be Considered by the Special CourtThe Commission recommends amending Section 4 of the POCSO Act, which deals with punishment for penetrative sexual assault, by adding subsections (4) to (9). These additions provide the Special Court with the discretion to impose lesser sentences based on various factors, including the child\u2019s tacit approval, the age difference between the parties, the absence of criminal antecedents, good conduct by the accused, and the absence of undue influence or coercion.Moreover, the Special Court may seek the assistance of experienced psychologists or psycho-social workers to assess relevant matters, and it can issue necessary orders to protect the child\u2019s interests until they reach the age of eighteen years.Adolescents Involved in Sexual Activity to Be Treated under the JJ Act.The report also suggests that in cases of sexual offenses under the POCSO Act against children aged 16 or older, the case may be disposed of under Section 18 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, if the Juvenile Justice Board or the Special Court determines that special and adequate reasons exist. These reasons of determining included circumstances outlined in Sections 4 and 8 of the POCSO Act, such as tacit approval of the child and a minimum age difference of 3 years between the consenting parties.The recommended proviso and explanation are to be added to Section 18 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, allowing the Juvenile Justice Board to impose sentences other than imprisonment, such as admonishment, community service, counseling, or release on probation with good conduct conditions.It is worth noting that last year, the Karnataka High Court had instructed the Commission to reconsider the age of consent to address concerns related to teenage relationships. Several other High Courts have also expressed reservations about the criminalization of adolescent sexual activity.The report was prepared by a panel led by Justice Rituraj Awasthi (former Karnataka HC CJ), Justice KT Sankaran (former Kerala HC CJ), Professor (Dr) Anand Paliwal, and Professor DP Verma.", "Bombay HC to Deliver Verdict on IT Rules Amendment Challenge of establishing fact check Unit to find fake News on Media Platform": "LI NetworkPublished on: 30 September 2023 at 00:28 ISTThe Bombay High Court is set to announce its judgment on December 1, 2023, concerning multiple petitions challenging Rule 3(i)(II)(C) of the IT Amendment Rules, 2023. This rule empowers a government-established Fact Check Unit to identify false, fake, or misleading information about the government on social media platforms.Consequently, social media intermediaries such as Facebook, Instagram, or others will be required to either remove the flagged content or add a disclaimer at their own risk, as per the Ministry of Electronics and Information & Technology.The division bench of Justice GS Patel and Justice Neela Gokhale has reserved the pleas filed by political satirist Kunal Kamra, News Broadcasters and Digital Association, Editor\u2019s Guild of India, and the Association of Indian Magazines for final orders.Court stated \u201cArguments have concluded. We permit counsels to submit supplementary notes of arguments by October 14. Mr. Mehta [Solicitor General] says the statement not to notify the Fact Check Unit will extend until the pronouncement of the Judgment. The Judgment will be pronounced on December 1, 2023.\u201dSolicitor General Tushar Mehta clarified on Wednesday that social media intermediaries are not at liberty to take \u201cno action\u201d when content is flagged as fake, false, or misleading by the Fact Check Unit.The Central Government, in response to Kamra\u2019s petition, submitted a detailed affidavit stating that if a social media or news website continues to host information flagged by the Government\u2019s FCU as \u2018false\u2019 or \u2018misleading,\u2019 it will have to defend its actions in court.During courtroom discussions, Senior Advocate Navroz Seervai, representing Kamra, highlighted the lack of remedies available to users if their content is flagged by the FCU as fake, false, or misleading (FFM). He argued that the central government is the sole decision-maker in such cases, and the only recourse for users is through a writ petition.Seervai also argued that the central government is essentially asking the court to rewrite legislation by limiting the meaning of the term \u201cinformation\u201d to \u201cfacts.\u201d He stressed that terms like \u201cfake,\u201d \u201cfact,\u201d and \u201cmisleading\u201d are overly broad and lead to arbitrariness and discrimination, violating Articles 14 and 19 of the Constitution.Regarding the interpretation of the term \u201cbusiness of the government,\u201d Seervai contended that it encompasses a wide range of activities, including those listed in the Concurrent List of the Constitution, making it exceptionally broad.Seervai questioned the classification of the government as a distinct class and argued that the government\u2019s FCU should not have privileges or powers beyond those of other independent FCUs. He asserted that this classification lacks a demonstrable connection to the intended objectives.Seervai concluded his arguments by stating that the Rule is ultra vires Articles 14 and 19(1)(a) of the Constitution and should be struck down.Senior Advocate Arvind Datar, representing the News Broadcasters and Digital Association, countered the government\u2019s assertion that the FCU serves in an advisory capacity. He stated, \u201cThe Solicitor General tried to argue that the FCU is an advisory. It\u2019s not a travel advisory. It is a binding dictat and order.\u201dJustice GS Patel questioned the meaning of the FCU\u2019s declaration of something as fake. He inquired, \u201cIs the source fake, is the information fake? What part of it is fake? Can a valid rule operate under such ambiguity?\u201d The bench also wondered what kind of disclaimer intermediaries could use when content is flagged by the FCU.Datar also raised a scenario in which national newspapers publish content on social media platforms. He asked, \u201cIf a national newspaper publishes something, can the government declare it as fake and demand its removal? In that case, how can an intermediary be told that something is fake, false, and misleading, and asked to take it down?\u201d Datar argued that if TV news and online channels cannot be regulated in this manner, the same principle should apply to social media intermediaries.Justice Patel noted a potential inconsistency where content published in print media remains unaffected while the same content posted online is taken down due to FCU identification. He commented, \u201cSee, the business of the government is the business of every newspaper. We are leaving people like Mr. Kamra aside for a moment. Is there an obligation on the newspaper to print only what the government approves? Now, take the item from print and also post it on their social media platform. After the FCU, the online item is taken down, but the print item remains untouched. That is an inconsistency I don\u2019t know how to deal with.\u201dDatar argued that the government should not be allowed to create overly broad laws and then request the court to impose restrictions on them. He stated that reading down can only occur when there is a conflict between two statutes.Datar challenged the government\u2019s assertion that the Rules serve the public interest. He argued that public interest is not mentioned in Article 19(2) (reasonable restrictions); public interest is only mentioned in Articles 19(3) to 19(6). Article 19(2) primarily addresses issues of order, not the concept of public interest.Justice Patel questioned how the court could be expected to limit the scope of the word \u2018information\u2019 defined under the IT Act and determine precisely what falls under the ambit of \u2018information\u2019 under Section 3(1)(b)(5) and how to restrict it to facts.Justice Patel also noted that illustrations could not be used to decide the vires of a provision. He stated, \u201cWe can\u2019t navigate vires and constitutionality based on examples. For example \u2013 What\u2019s happening between Canada and India. We cannot use this to interpret the vires of the Rule.\u201dDatar concluded by stating, \u201cThe Rule cannot be read down; it has to be struck down. This tumor has to be incised and removed. The freedom of speech is the most cherished right; please protect it.\u201dAdvocate Shadan Farsat, representing Editor\u2019s Guild, added, \u201c\u2018Facts\u2019 about the \u2018business of the government\u2019 even when structured narrowly have so many interpretations. There are different interpretations of the government and others on the number of Covid deaths, sufficiency of oxygen, farmers\u2019 deaths.\u201dThe new rule requires social media platforms to make reasonable efforts to prevent users from publishing information identified as \u2018false\u2019 or \u2018misleading\u2019 in respect of any government business by the government\u2019s Fact Check Unit.", "President Grants Approval to 106th Constitutional Amendment Act Enabling Women\u2019s Reservation in Lok Sabha & State Assemblies": "LI NetworkPublished on: 30 September 2023 at 00:11 ISTThe President of India has granted approval to the Constitution (106th Amendment) Act of 2023, which introduces a 1/3rd reservation for women in the Lok Sabha and State Legislative Assemblies.This amendment will come into effect on a date designated by the Central Government through an official notification in the Gazette.The Parliament passed the bill during the recently concluded Special Session, On September 21, the Rajya Sabha unanimously approved the bill, which had received support from two-thirds of the members present and voting in the Lok Sabha on the previous day (with 454 members in favor and 2 opposing).The Constitution Amendment Bill aims to implement a 33 percent reservation for women in the Lower House of Parliament, state legislatures, and the Delhi legislative assembly. It is important to note that the women\u2019s reservation will only be enforced after a delimitation exercise is conducted following the first census conducted after the bill\u2019s enactment. This reservation for women will remain in effect for a period of 15 years from its commencement.The 2023 bill proposes an amendment to Article 239AA (Special provisions with respect to Delhi) and the introduction of three new articles: Articles 330A, 332A, and 334A. The first two articles seek to introduce a 33 percent reservation in the Lok Sabha and state legislative assemblies, respectively. Notably, this reservation is set to be enforced following a delimitation exercise conducted for this purpose after the bill\u2019s enactment, although the sunset clause remains unchanged. Unlike the previous bill, the provisions concerning reservation for the Anglo-Indian community in Articles 331 and 333 have not been altered.", "Patna High Court: Jurisdiction Cannot Be Conferred by Consent": "LI NetworkPublished on: 29 September 2023 at 17:19 ISTThe Patna High Court has ruled that parties cannot confer jurisdiction on a court or authority that lacks jurisdiction, even with their consent. This declaration was made while considering an application to set aside an award issued by the Permanent Lok Adalat in a Partition Suit, which had divided the suit property between the petitioners and the private respondents based on a compromise petition.Justice Sandeep Kumar, in a Single Bench, emphasized, \u201cA Court/Authority having no jurisdiction in the matter cannot be conferred jurisdiction by the parties with their consent, and the order passed by the said Court/Authority having no jurisdiction over the subject matter is a nullity in the eye of the law.\u201dIn this case, the petitioner, a practicing lawyer based in Patna, often stayed in the city. The petitioner\u2019s son and the respondent, who was the petitioner\u2019s brother, decided to partition their property equally since they were full brothers and the property belonged to them alone. Consequently, the petitioner and the respondent jointly filed a Partition Suit in the Permanent Lok Adalat for partition. A settlement was reached between the parties, and the petitioner and his son were summoned to the Civil Court by the respondent. They were informed that a compromise petition was being prepared, dividing the ancestral property into equal shares. Based on this representation, the petitioners signed the compromise petition.After the compromise, the petitioner began cultivating his half-share of the agricultural property. However, in 2011, the petitioner\u2019s son was diagnosed with a kidney ailment, and the petitioner intended to sell a portion of his share of the property to fund his son\u2019s treatment. The petitioner accepted an advance of Rs. 2,00,000 from a buyer. The respondent objected to the sale, arguing that the petitioner could not sell his half-share as it was smaller. The petitioner then applied for a certified copy of the Permanent Lok Adalat\u2019s award and discovered that the respondent had deceived him. The schedule showed that the respondent had been granted one-fourth of the property. Realizing the fraud, the petitioners approached the High Court through a writ petition.The High Court determined that in this case, the subject matter of the Partition Suit did not pertain to any Public Utility Services over which the Permanent Lok Adalat could exercise jurisdiction.Consequently, the High Court declared that the Permanent Lok Adalat\u2019s award was made without jurisdiction and allowed the application to set aside the award.Case Title: Lallan Pandey & Anr. v. The State of Bihar & Ors.", "Karnataka High Court Affirms Reinstatement Unnecessary if Individual Gainfully Employed": "LI NetworkPublished on: 29 September 2023 at 16:59 ISTThe Karnataka High Court has reaffirmed that reinstatement does not come into play when an individual is gainfully employed. This assertion came in a case involving a limited company engaged in the production and sale of diesel generators, with the respondent serving as a Supervisor. Reinstatement refers to the action of giving someone back a position they have lost. The respondent\u2019s probationary period had been extended several times on compassionate grounds. However, following the final extension, the respondent failed to secure alternative employment, and the company requested the return of its No Objection Certificates (NOCs). In response, the respondent claimed that his services had been terminated. The matter was then brought before the Labour Court, which ruled in favor of the respondent, ordering the petitioner company to reinstate him with continuous service and benefits, albeit without back wages. The petitioner contested this decision through a writ petition.A Bench presided over by Justice Jyoti Mulimani emphasized that \u201cthe law is well settled that if a person is gainfully employed, the question of reinstatement does not arise. That apart, it is not in dispute that the respondent was on probation period and his service was not confirmed. Hence, the question of reinstatement does not arise.\u201dThe Court acknowledged that the respondent held the position of a \u201cSupervisor,\u201d and the terms of his appointment permitted termination during the probationary period without notice or cause. Notably, the respondent\u2019s probationary period had been extended on multiple occasions.The Court elaborated, stating, \u201cIt is not in dispute that the respondent was appointed as a Supervisor but, he was paid a salary of more than Rs.10,000/- (Rupees Ten Thousand only) per month. Hence, in view of Section 2(S)(iv) of the I.D Act, he cannot be considered as the workman. Furthermore, a perusal of the Writ Papers would reveal that certain documents are filed to show that the respondent is gainfully employed.\u201dThe Court stressed that when an individual is gainfully employed, the concept of reinstatement does not apply. Additionally, since the respondent\u2019s probation had not been confirmed, there was no valid basis for reinstatement.Consequently, the Court granted the writ petition, overturning the Labor Court\u2019s decision.Case Title: M/S. Powerica Limited (DTA Unit) v. Manjunath Pattar, [2023:KHC:33603", "Madras HC Approves \u2018URELOG\u2019 Trademark rejecting Self-Evident fusion of Urea Claim": "LI NetworkPublished on: 29 September 2023 at 15:36 ISTThe Madras High Court has ruled in favor of the advertisement of the \u2018URELOG\u2019 trademark, rejecting claims that the word is a self-evident fusion of \u201curine\u201d or \u201curea.\u201d This decision highlights that marks consisting of derived elements like \u201cURE\u201d and \u201cLAC\u201d typically receive lower degrees of protection compared to arbitrary or fanciful marks.The High Court\u2019s decision came in response to an appeal under Section 91 of the Trademark Act, 1999, which sought to overturn the Examiner\u2019s decision regarding the \u2018URELOG\u2019 mark and secure its registration.In a ruling by Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy, it was stated that \u201cconsidering the explanation regarding the reason for adopting the mark, the presence of multiple marks containing the element \u2018URE,\u2019 and the fact that \u2018URELOG\u2019 is not a self-evident fusion of urea/urine and ketoanalogue, the challenged order should be set aside, and the application should be accepted for advertisement.\u201dThe case revolved around the appellant\u2019s application to register the word mark \u2018URELOG\u2019 on a \u201cproposed to be used\u201d basis. The Registrar of Trademarks raised objections under Section 11 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999, citing three similar marks. In response, the appellant argued that the \u2018URELOG\u2019 mark is distinctive and was coined honestly, combining \u2018URE\u2019 related to the kidney and \u2018LOG\u2019 derived from \u2018KETOANALOGUE,\u2019 a kidney-related supplement. Despite this, the Registrar refused permission after a hearing.Upon reviewing the appellant\u2019s materials, the Bench found that \u201cURE\u201d is derived from \u201curea\u201d or \u201curine.\u201d Similarly, \u201cLOG\u201d appeared to have been derived from \u201cKETOANALOGUE,\u201d a supplement for renal function improvement.The Bench also considered the number of marks registered with the elements \u201cURE\u201d and \u201cLAC\u201d and the explanation for adopting the mark provided by the appellant.As a result, the High Court approved the trademark application.Case Title: TIL Healthcare Private Limited v. Registrar of Trademarks ", "Calcutta HC Emphasizes the Significance of Parties Intent in Arbitration Clause Insertion": "LI NetworkPublished on: 29 September 2023 at 15:20 ISTThe Calcutta High Court has underscored the importance of considering the parties\u2019 intent when incorporating an arbitration clause.In this case, the petitioner filed an application under Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, seeking an injunction to prevent Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL) from invoking and encashing the performance bank guarantee issued by Punjab and Sind Bank (P&S Bank) and the modified performance bank guarantee.A Single Bench, presided over by Justice Moushumi Bhattacharya, observed, \u201cIn the present case, the arbitration clause in the GCC and in the Work Order specifies that the seat of arbitration shall be Kolkata but clarifies that the seat will be the place from where the contract is issued. The latter part is within brackets. The ordinary and plain meaning of this clause, with due weight given to the intention of the parties while inserting this clause, post-amendment, cannot and would not point to any other construction besides holding that the parties intended to \u2018seat\u2019 the arbitration at the place from where the contract is issued.\u201dThe Court explained that interpreting an agreement involves principles of contract construction and requires ascertaining the meaning that the document would convey to a reasonable person with knowledge of the background reasonably available to the parties when the contract was formed.Background:The dispute arose from a contract containing an arbitration agreement. BHEL contended that the seat of arbitration would be the location from which the contract was issued, giving precedence to the bracketed portion. In contrast, the petitioner argued that the parties intended the seat of arbitration to be in Kolkata, with the bracketed portion inserted solely to determine the venue for the convenience of the parties/arbitrator.The key issue for consideration regarding maintainability was whether the parties intended the seat of arbitration to be the place where the contract was issued, specifically Salt Lake City, Kolkata, or the Kolkata courts in general. If the respondent\u2019s position was correct, the High Court would lack jurisdiction, and the application would be referred to the Commercial Court at Rajarhat.The High Court, considering the factual context, noted, \u201cThe entire contract documents, including the NIT and the correspondence between the parties, including the termination letter, specify at the bottom of each page the place of issue of the contract, which is \u2018Power Sector Eastern Region (PSER), DJ-9/1, Salt Lake City, Kolkata \u2013 700091.\u2019 This is the place from where the tender has been issued.\u201dThe Court concluded that the agreed seat of arbitration falls within the metropolitan area of Kolkata, within the jurisdiction of the Commercial Court at Rajarhat. Consequently, the original territorial jurisdiction of the Calcutta High Court would not apply in this case.The Court upheld the respondent\u2019s argument regarding non-maintainability and dismissed the application accordingly.Case Title: Harji Engineering Works Pvt. Ltd. v. Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited & Anr.Also Read: A Study of Appeals under Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 \u2013 Law Insider India", "Kerala HC Rules Property Cannot Be Frozen Under Section 17(1-A) of PMLA Without ECIR and FIR": "LI NetworkPublished on: 29 September 2023 at 15:10 ISTKerala HC held that if the Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) has been quashed and no subsequent FIR has been registered against the accused, then an order under Section 17(1-A) of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA) cannot be enforced. This ruling came as the Court considered that such an order would prejudice the individual against whom it is issued.Section 17(1-A) of the PMLA serves as an alternative to Section 17(1) and allows authorized officers to issue freezing orders when a search and seizure operation is not feasible.Justice Devan Ramachandran, who presided over the bench, emphasized, \u201c\u2026when there is no FIR registered, hypostasized on which an \u2018ECIR\u2019 is also not available, any further investigation against the petitioner under the \u2018PMLA\u2019 will have to cease\u2026I am certain, without any doubt, that in view of quashing of the \u2018ECIR\u2019 and in the absence of any further FIR being registered against the petitioner, Ext.P12 cannot be allowed to hold the field, particularly when it causes sure prejudice to the person against which it is issued.\u201dSenior Advocate Mahesh Jethmalani, instructed by D. Kishore and representing the petitioner, argued that the case registered by the Enforcement Directorate under the PMLA had been quashed by the Court. Consequently, Ext.P12, the order in question, had no legal basis and should be set aside.In this case, the Standing Counsel, Jaishankar V. Nair, representing the Enforcement Directorate, contended that the order (Ext.P12) was issued when the petitioner faced criminal charges under Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) initiated by the jurisdictional Police Authorities. Since Section 420 IPC is one of the scheduled offenses under Section 2(1)(y) of the PMLA, and the ECIR had been registered on September 6, 2022, it was necessary to protect the properties covered by Ext.P12 from depletion or destruction.Referring to the Vijay Madanlal Choudhary case, it was further argued that additional information against the petitioner had come to light during the investigation, and this information was being examined by the police. The bench, however, pointed out that no new FIR had been registered in connection with this information.The bench concluded that without an FIR and ECIR, further PMLA investigation against the petitioner would have to cease. It also highlighted that the Court had made it clear that if the predicate offense were to be revived, the Enforcement Directorate would be free to restart proceedings under the PMLA. Therefore, the bench allowed the writ petition and set aside Ext.P12.Case Title: V.P. Nandakumar V.

The Adjudicating Authority initially denied these amendments, stating that they could only be allowed if the required documents existed at the time of export. Subsequent appeals to the Commissioner of Customs (Appeal) were also rejected.The respondents then filed second appeals, leading the Customs, Excise, and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal (CESTAT) to rule in their favor. CESTAT held that the applicability of Section 149 of the Customs Act, which pertains to the amendment of documents, is based on whether documentary evidence existed when the goods were exported.The Delhi High Court examined Section 149 of the Customs Act and found that it did not specify a time limit for amending documents to seek rebates or benefits. Furthermore, it did not outline specific grounds for requesting amendments. The section allows proposed amendments supported by documentary evidence that existed at the time of export.In this case, the respondents had submitted all relevant documents containing the necessary information along with their request letters for amendment. The Proper Officer had not served any notices pointing out deficiencies in the documents. Therefore, the High Court concluded that there was no legal issue or incorrect approach in granting the respondents the STR benefit based on their exports during the relevant period.Case title: \u201cCommissioner of Customs V.

However, any adaptations of the said work, including providing explanations, summaries, meanings, exegesis/interpretations, or creating any audio-visual works (e.g., television series like Ramanand Sagar\u2019s Ramayana or B.R. Chopra\u2019s Mahabharata), dramatic works created by drama societies based on scriptures, etc., being transformative works, would be entitled to copyright protection \u2013 being original works of the Authors themselves.\u201dThe court emphasized that while the actual reproduction of texts from scriptures is not objectionable, the interpretation provided by different gurus and spiritual teachers can vary. Copyright would then apply to the original parts of literary works that explain or teach the scriptures.In this case, The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, India, filed the suit as a trust established by His Divine Grace A.C.

This decision came as the NCLAT Chennai permitted the simultaneous consolidation and initiation of the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process for corporate debtors associated with the now-defunct wind turbine manufacturer, Regen Powertech Pvt Ltd, and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Regen Infrastructure and Services.In a recent ruling issued by the Chennai division of the NCLAT, the judicial member Justice Venugopal M and technical member Shreesha Merla overturned a November 2021 order from the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) that had rejected several petitions seeking the consolidation and simultaneous initiation of the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process.Regen\u2019s Resolution Professionals were represented by senior counsel, who opposed the requests for consolidation. They argued that combined CIRP was not mandated by the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) and asserted that this case did not warrant invoking equity jurisdiction. They contended that the appellants did not qualify as operational creditors since they were service purchasers.The NCLAT clarified that, in this particular case, the consolidation of CIRPs could be authorized \u201cnot as a matter of its equity jurisdiction\u201d but rather with the aim of \u201cmaximizing the value of assets and value addition,\u201d which aligns with the primary objective of the IBC.The NCLAT further stated, \u201cConsolidation is based on the principle that the Holding and the Subsidiary Units would be regarded as a \u2018Single Unit\u2019 owing to the nature of business activity and this cannot be construed as a principle in \u2018Equity\u2019 but a \u2018Legal principle\u2019.

These factors collectively led the judge to acquit all the accused in the case.The background of the case involves a food inspector from the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) initiating a criminal case against Hindustan Unilever and its office bearers (petitioners) over the alleged misbranding of their Red Label tea product.The company was accused of contravening Section 38 of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, which prohibits the use of any reference to the Act, its rules, etc., on product labels. Additionally, the company faced charges of violating Section 39, which prohibits the use of phrases like \u2018recommended by medical profession.\u2019In 2014, the petitioners were convicted for misbranding the product by a municipal magistrate, who imposed a sentence of six months of simple imprisonment along with a fine of \u20b95,000.Subsequently, a sessions court in Kolkata set aside the conviction, but the matter was referred back to the municipal magistrate for reconsideration.In response, the company approached the High Court, challenging the decision of the Sessions Court to remand the matter to the Municipal Magistrate.The High Court granted the plea and concluded that the Sessions Court should have acquitted the accused rather than ordering a retrial.The High Court contended that the Sessions Court should have dismissed the entire prosecution case, given the discrepancies in the prosecution\u2019s arguments and the potential prejudice to the accused.Hence, the High Court acquitted all the accused involved in the case.", "Wife\u2019s Desire to Stay with Husband at His Workplace Not Deemed as Cruelty by Chhattisgarh HC": "LI NetworkPublished on: 29 September 2023 at 12:27 ISTThe Chhattisgarh High Court has ruled that a wife\u2019s insistence on residing with her husband at the location of his work assignment does not constitute cruelty as defined by the Hindu Marriage Act [Ravishankar Shrivas vs Sarita Sen].A division bench comprising Justices Goutam Bhaduri and Deepak Kumar Tiwari emphasized the importance of mutual respect, regard, and companionship in matrimonial relationships. The court stated that if a wife wishes to live with her husband at his workplace location, and there is no valid external reason or official impediment, the husband\u2019s refusal cannot be considered cruelty on her part.Consequently, the court dismissed the appeal filed by a husband who had contested the Family Court\u2019s decision from June 28, 2019. The Family Court in Janjgir had rejected the husband\u2019s plea for divorce on the grounds of cruelty.The couple in question had tied the knot on May 19, 2005, and initially enjoyed a harmonious marital life. However, the relationship gradually soured, with the husband alleging that his wife demanded separate living arrangements apart from her in-laws. He claimed that her insistence often led to conflicts. Moreover, the husband stated that in June 2009, his wife left their matrimonial home of her own accord and only returned in December 2009. She subsequently departed again without any apparent reason.The husband contended that after the demise of his mother in 2012 and father in 2015, he had urged his wife to return to their matrimonial home, but she refused.On the contrary, the wife argued that their marital bliss had lasted for just five years after their wedding. She asserted that when she requested her husband to accompany her to his workplace and allow her to reside with him there, he declined. According to her, since 2010, he had started neglecting her, prompting her to leave their matrimonial residence.After considering these arguments, the bench observed that it was the husband who had refused to let his wife stay with him at his workplace, without providing any reason in his petition or deposition for his reluctance.In light of the husband\u2019s conduct and his failure to make any efforts to reconcile or file an application for the restitution of conjugal rights, the bench concluded that the mere assertion in the complaint that the wife had been residing separately since December 2009 without a valid reason could not be substantiated.As a result, the appeal was dismissed, and the husband was directed to pay interim maintenance of \u20b915,000 to his wife.", "Delhi HC: Denying Child\u2019s Affection to other parent is Grounds for Mental Cruelty": "LI NetworkPublished on: 29 September 2023 at 11:15 ISTThe Delhi High Court has ruled that intentionally denying a child\u2019s affection to the other parent constitutes mental cruelty, thereby upholding the divorce of a separated couple.In an appeal filed by the wife against a 2018 family court decision granting divorce, the court found that the daughter had been alienated and used as a weapon against her husband, who is an army officer. Justices Suresh Kumar Kait and Neena Bansal Krishna dismissed the appeal, emphasizing that such child alienation is an extreme form of mental cruelty towards a father who has never neglected his child.The court acknowledged the disputes between the couple, who married in 1996, but stressed that involving the child in their bitterness and turning her against her father was inappropriate. Any act by a parent calculated to deny the other parent affection is considered alienation, amounting to mental cruelty.The court also rejected the wife\u2019s objections about the husband\u2019s daily alcohol consumption, stating that regular alcohol consumption alone doesn\u2019t equate to being an alcoholic or having a bad character when there were no adverse incidents. The court noted that making friends at the workplace while living separately due to work requirements cannot be considered cruelty.Regarding the husband\u2019s earlier intimate relationship with another woman, which had been condoned by the wife, the court ruled it couldn\u2019t be viewed as cruelty in the divorce petition. However, the court found that the wife\u2019s vindictive actions, including filing complaints against the husband and alienating their daughter, demonstrated various acts of cruelty toward him.The husband sought divorce based on several grounds, including the wife\u2019s refusal to join him at his duty stations due to his Army postings, her interference with his relationship with their daughter, and her unilateral cessation of cohabitation in 2008. The court upheld the divorce on grounds of cruelty, even though desertion was not proven.", "Karnataka HC Rules Amendment to Draft of Sale Deed Requires Amendments to Plaint & Decree Schedules as well": "LI NetworkPublished on: 29 September 2023 at 11:05 ISTThe Karnataka High Court has issued a ruling stating that a decree holder must first amend the plaint schedule and decree schedule before making amendments to the draft sale deed.The petitioner, who was the decree holder in this case, had approached the court after application under Order 6 Rule 17 of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC) seeking an amendment to the draft sale deed which was rejected.Justice S.G. Pandit, presiding over a Single Bench, noted, \u201cHaving heard the learned counsel for the parties and on perusing the writ petition papers, I am of the view that no ground is made out to interfere with the order passed by the trial Judge, rejecting the amendment application filed by the petitioner decree holder. Unless the petitioner decree holder gets amended the plaint schedule as well as decree schedule, mere amendment to the draft sale deed would not be permissible.\u201dBackground of the Case:The petitioner, as the decree holder, had filed a suit for specific performance of a contract, which resulted in a judgment and decree in 2017. The High Court confirmed this decree earlier in the current year. In order to execute the decree, the petitioner filed an execution petition before the Senior Civil Judge, who subsequently ordered the execution of the sale deed through a Court Commissioner.However, the Court Commissioner returned the draft sale deed. Consequently, the petitioner decree holder filed an application under Order 6 Rule 17 of the CPC. In the affidavit, the petitioner explained that, based on the Court Commissioner\u2019s report, Survey number 65/8 had been altered to 65/43, which was now owned by M.S. Manjunath @ Sombegowda, necessitating an amendment to the draft sale deed.In light of these circumstances, the High Court observed, \u201cThe Executing Court is required to execute the decree as it is and the executing Court cannot go beyond the decree. The observations made by the Executing Court in that regard are correct and need no interference.\u201dThe Court further clarified that Order 6 Rule 17 of the CPC could not be invoked to amend the draft sale deed as requested in the application.As a result, the High Court disposed of the writ petition, allowing the petitioner to pursue any other appropriate legal remedy available.Case Title: Jayanthi @ Rangamma v.

Lakshman and K. Sujana, heard an appeal challenging the verdict of the Special Sessions Judge for SC/ST (POA). In that judgment, the appellant was convicted under Sections 417, 306 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), and Section 3(2)(v) of the SC/ST (POA) Act, 1989.The case involved a deceased individual belonging to the Nayakapu caste, categorized under the Scheduled Tribe (ST). The accused was a toddy tapper who had previously attempted to commit rape in 2007. During the trial, the accused proposed a compromise to the deceased, offering to marry her. She agreed, and the case was settled. However, the accused later developed an illegal relationship with the deceased, deceiving her with promises of marriage after his sister\u2019s wedding.When the accused announced his impending marriage to another woman, the deceased, along with her brother and another person, confronted him. The accused responded by verbally abusing them, stating he would not marry the deceased due to her caste and instructing her to consume poison and die. The deceased followed this instruction and consumed pesticide, leading to her death. The accused was charged with offenses under Sections 417, 306 IPC, and Sections 3(1)(x), 3(1)(xii), 3(2)(v) of the SC/ST Act, and was subsequently convicted.The primary issue before the bench was whether uttering the words \u201cgo and die\u201d was sufficient to prove instigation under Section 107 of IPC.The High Court clarified that to establish an offense under Section 306 IPC, the prosecution must prove that the deceased committed suicide due to the accused\u2019s abetment. The bench referred to a precedent, State of West Bengal Vs. Orilal Jaiaswal and Another, which cautioned that courts must exercise extreme care in evaluating the facts and circumstances of each case. It emphasized that ordinary petulance, discord, and domestic disputes common to society should not be deemed to induce suicide. The court should refrain from finding an accused guilty of abetment unless sufficient evidence of mens rea (criminal intent) exists.The bench concluded that the mere utterance of the words \u201cgo and die\u201d did not constitute the offense under Section 306 IPC. It asserted that mens rea was a necessary element of instigation, and words spoken during a quarrel or in the heat of the moment did not demonstrate criminal intent. The prosecution failed to prove mens rea in this case, and the evidence did not suffice to establish offenses under Sections 306 and 417 IPC.Consequently, the bench deemed the impugned judgment legally unsustainable and ordered the acquittal of the accused under Section 417, 306 IPC, and Section 3(2)(v) of the SC/ST (POA) Act, 1989.", "Accused Granted Benefit of Doubt by Madras HC Due to Contradictions and Lack of Corroboration in Illegal Gratification Case": "LI NetworkPublished on: 29 September 2023 at 10:38 ISTThe Madras High Court has overturned the conviction and sentence passed by a Special Judge under the Prevention of Corruption Act. The court ruled that the tainted money found in the accused\u2019s table drawer, along with the explanation that the money had been planted there by a prosecution witness while the accused was away, is a plausible explanation.Justice G. Jayachandran, presiding over a Single Judge Bench, emphasized that the prosecution\u2019s case lacked proof beyond a reasonable doubt, while the accused had substantiated their defense with a preponderance of probability. The numerous contradictions and lack of corroboration regarding foundational facts raised doubts about the prosecution\u2019s case, leading to the benefit of the doubt being granted to the accused.The court also noted that documentary evidence indicated that until July 29, 2003, the application from the complainant had never reached the accused\u2019s hands and was with another individual. This raised doubts about the prosecution\u2019s version and cast doubt on the foundation of the case.In this case, the appellant, who was a Commercial Inspector at the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board, was caught in a trap set by a V&AC Inspector, who provided him with Rs. 1000 as part of a police operation.As a result, he was prosecuted and found guilty by the Trial Court for demanding and receiving Rs. 1000 as illegal gratification from the police. He was sentenced to one year of imprisonment and fined Rs. 5000 under Section 7 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, as well as two years of imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 10,000 under Section 13(2) read with Section 13(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act.After reviewing the submissions, the court concluded that the charge was limited to the incident that occurred on September 4, 2003, at the AE Office in Salem, in which the demand and acceptance of Rs. 1000 as illegal gratification, other than legal remuneration, occurred. The court noted that the modified charge, dated April 18, 2017, included incidents related to the application for temporary connection, meter shifting, and subsequent events.Although the charge under Section 7 of the Prevention of Corruption Act was not altered, the court found that the substance of the charge had significantly changed due to the trial court\u2019s actions. The court pointed out that the accused had not requested to recall witnesses after the charge was altered, which resulted in apparent prejudice seen in the prosecution exhibits and witnesses.The court also noted that the complainant had interacted with the AE Office for over a year, and there was no previous complaint of bribery when seeking temporary connection and meter shifting. The first alleged demand was made on July 28, 2003, according to the complaint. However, endorsements on the application indicated that the complainant paid the fees for shifting only on July 28, 2003, and the application remained with the AE until July 29, 2003. This discrepancy cast doubt on the prosecution\u2019s version.Furthermore, the court explained that cost estimation was subject to the approval of a superior officer and was not determined arbitrarily by the Commercial Inspector but based on department-prescribed cost rates, revised annually. Given the inconsistencies in the prosecution witness\u2019s reasons for the alleged demand for a bribe, the court found that the allegations lacked both corroboration and were contrary to documents, rendering them improbable.In conclusion, the Madras High Court held that the prosecution\u2019s case lacked proof beyond a reasonable doubt, leading to the benefit of the doubt being granted to the accused.Case Title: N.

The High Court made this decision after finding significant contradictions in the testimonies of the deceased\u2019s sons and a lack of medical evidence to support the prosecution\u2019s case.Chief Justice Pritinker Diwaker, along with Justice Om Prakash Shukla, presided over the bench and stated, \u201cThorough examination of the evidence makes it clear that the prosecution has failed to prove its case beyond all reasonable doubts.\u201dThe appellant, represented by Advocates Rohit Tripathi, Sajjad Husain, and Syed Zulfiqar Husain Naqvi, filed a Criminal Appeal challenging the judgment and order of the Trial Court. The case involved charges under Sections 302 and 34 of the IPC and Section 5 of the Explosive Substances Act, 1908. The Trial Court had sentenced the appellant to life imprisonment with a fine of Rs. 10,000 and ten years of rigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs. 5,000. According to the prosecution, the appellant and a co-accused entered a dairy armed with bombs and weapons, where the deceased Zaheer Muneer and others were sleeping, causing various injuries to the deceased, including burn injuries from the explosion of crude bombs.The High Court noted that upon examining the evidence, it was evident that the prosecution had not proven its case beyond reasonable doubt. The court found that the testimonies of the deceased\u2019s sons lacked credibility and contained significant inconsistencies. Additionally, the Autopsy Surgeon\u2019s opinion stated that the burn injuries on the deceased could not have been caused by the explosion of a bomb. Therefore, the medical evidence did not support the prosecution\u2019s case, making it insufficient to convict the appellant.Furthermore, the High Court noted that no incriminating substances were found on the appellant, and a bloody knife recovered from the scene did not provide conclusive evidence since the blood was disintegrated.The Court cited the cases of Chander Pal v State of Haryana [(2002) and Sadananda Mondal v State of West Bengal (2013), emphasizing that the Trial Court had erred in convicting the appellant.Consequently, the High Court allowed the appeal and set aside the impugned judgment.Case Title: Suhel V State of U.P", "U.P Government: Surgical Procedures are Performed Without License at Sanjay Gandhi Hospital to Allahabad HC": "LI NetworkPublished on: 29 September 2023 at 10:30 ISTThe Uttar Pradesh government has informed the Allahabad High Court that surgeries were being conducted at Sanjay Gandhi Hospital in Amethi, despite the hospital lacking the necessary license to perform such procedures.The Lucknow Bench of the High Court was addressing a petition filed by the hospital, which is operated by a trust chaired by Congress leader Sonia Gandhi. The petition challenged the suspension of the hospital\u2019s license, which occurred following the death of a patient earlier this month.A bench comprising Justices Vivek Chaudhary and Manish Kumar requested information regarding the investigation into the patient\u2019s death.The license for Sanjay Gandhi Hospital was revoked on September 17, and the facility was sealed after a woman admitted for a minor operation passed away on September 14.

These notices claim that Dream11 evaded Goods and Services Tax (GST) totaling more than \u20b91,200 crores (approximately $163 million), excluding interest and penalties.The notices are linked to the financial years 2017-18 and 2018-19, accusing Dream11 of evading 28% GST on the amounts collected for offering gambling-related services to users. Dream11, which is presently a sponsor of the Indian national cricket team, asserts that these notices are based on the erroneous assumption that their services constitute gambling.Sporta Technology, the entity behind Dream11, has clarified that GST on actionable claims should not be applicable to them since they neither act as a supplier nor a recipient of such claims. They emphasize that they merely provide a platform for users to engage in fantasy sports. Additionally, Sporta Technology contends that the notices lack jurisdiction, as they contradict the established position of the Supreme Court, which recognizes online fantasy sports as primarily skill-based rather than gambling or betting.The plea, filed through TLC Legal LLP, challenges the ongoing investigation initiated by the Deputy Commissioner of the State Tax department and the Directorate General of GST Intelligence regarding the alleged tax evasion. It also contests the notices issued by the GST authorities, which sought documentation for the financial years 2017-18 and 2018-19.Sporta Technology argues that the notices retroactively apply amendments to the GST Act that assess online fantasy sports at a 28% rate. However, the company asserts that these amendments are effective only from October 1, 2023, and cannot be retroactively enforced.Notably, the petitioner in this plea also criticizes Section 15(5) of the Central GST Act, alleging it to be arbitrary and excessively delegating power. This section allows officers to determine the value of supplies for taxation purposes based on recommendations from the GST council, potentially granting them unchecked authority, according to the plea.", "[Landmark Judgement] Assn. of Vasanth Apartments\u2019 Owners V.

From the discussions made hereinabove relating to the principles for grant or refusal to grant of injunction to restrain enforcement of a bank guarantee or a letter of credit, we find that the following principles should be noted in the matter of injunction to restrain the encashment of a bank guarantee or a letter of credit:(i) While dealing with an application for injunction in the course of commercial dealings, and when an unconditional bank guarantee or letter of credit is given or accepted, the beneficiary is entitled to realise such a bank guarantee or a letter of credit in terms thereof irrespective of any pending disputes relating to the terms of the contract.(ii) The bank giving such guarantee is bound to honour it as per its terms irrespective of any dispute raised by its customer.(iii) The courts should be slow in granting an order of injunction to restrain the realisation of a bank guarantee or a letter of credit.(iv) Since a bank guarantee or a letter of credit is an independent and a separate contract and is absolute in nature, the existence of any dispute between the parties to the contract is not a ground for issuing an order of injunction to restrain enforcement of bank guarantees or letters of credit.(v) Fraud of an egregious nature which would vitiate the very foundation of such a bank guarantee or letter of credit and the beneficiary seeks to take advantage of the situation.(vi) Allowing encashment of an unconditional bank guarantee or a letter of credit would result in irretrievable harm or injustice to one of the parties concernedDrafted By Abhijit Mishra", "Prosecution Allowed to Present Unlisted Witnesses or Documents in Pursuit of Justice: Andhra Pradesh HC": "LI NetworkPublished on: 28 September 2023 at 15:30 ISTThe Andhra Pradesh High Court has declared that the prosecution is permitted to call any witnesses or present documents, even if they were not originally listed in the court\u2019s documents, as long as such additional evidence contributes to the fair determination of a case.This decision comes in response to a Criminal Petition challenging a Trial Court\u2019s order, in which the petitioner argued that the prosecution had introduced witnesses not originally listed in the chargesheet to bolster their case. The High Court emphasized that providing a list of witnesses and documents along with a police report is merely a customary practice and does not restrict the prosecution or the court.Justice B.V.L.N Chakravarthi stated, \u201cThe list of witnesses/documents filed with the Police report (Charge sheet) filed by the police is only a practice. It does not prevent the Prosecution or Magistrate/Court from examining any other witnesses or receiving documents if they help the Court to arrive at a just decision in the case.\u201dIn this case, the respondent had filed charges under Section 304-A of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC). A Magistrate had taken cognizance of the case, recorded the accused\u2019s statement under Section 251 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and scheduled the trial. During the trial, the prosecution presented two witnesses and later applied under Section 311 of the CrPC to summon additional witnesses. The petitioner approached the court under Section 482 of the CrPC, challenging the Trial Court\u2019s order. The petitioner claimed that the Trial Court had overlooked the prosecution\u2019s attempt to introduce new witnesses to bolster its case.The Court referred to Section 254(1) of the CrPC, which mandates that if a Magistrate does not convict the accused under sections 252 or 253, the magistrate must proceed to hear both the prosecution and defense, considering all evidence presented, including oral and documentary evidence, in accordance with the Law of Evidence. Additionally, the Court noted that Section 311 of the CrPC empowers the court to summon witnesses and examine or re-examine individuals already examined if their testimony is crucial for a just decision in the case.The Court clarified that during the evidence stage of trials for session cases, warrant cases, or summons cases, the Sessions Judge or Magistrate has the authority to admit any evidence in support of the prosecution, whether oral or documentary, regardless of whether it was listed in the police report (charge sheet) under Section 173 of the CrPC. However, the accused must be provided with copies of these statements or documents to exercise their right to cross-examination.The list of witnesses and documents submitted by the police is a customary practice and does not preclude the Prosecution or the Court from introducing additional witnesses or documents if they contribute to a just decision.The Court stressed that, in order to protect the rights of the accused, the Prosecution must provide copies of witness statements or documents collected during the investigation but not listed in the charge sheet before examining the proposed witnesses. The value of this additional evidence will be assessed later in the judgment.The Court reaffirmed that the purpose of every investigation and trial is not only to dispense justice but also to unearth the truth. The Court held that the principle of a fair investigation and trial is enshrined in Article 21 of the Constitution of India. The Prosecutor\u2019s duty is to present all essential facts, witnesses, and evidence impartially before the Court, whether it favors or opposes the accused, allowing the Court to make a decision.The Court highlighted its role in ensuring fair trials, citing the case of Zahira Habibullah Sheikh and Others v State of Gujarat and Others (2006).

The court emphasized the essential role of a regulatory body in overseeing and regulating medical professionals to safeguard public health.The bench, led by Chief Justice Prasanna B.

It noted that professionals, particularly medical practitioners, strive to uphold high standards of conduct and character that go beyond ordinary morality.The court observed, \u201cProfessionals in general and the Medical Practitioners in particular do aspire to an ideal defining a standard of good conduct, virtuous character and a commitment to excel beyond the norm of morality ordinarily governing relations among ordinary persons.\u201dThe appellant had approached the court through an Intra-Court Writ Appeal after the Trial Court dismissed his writ petition challenging the rejection of his registration application under the Act. The crucial point of contention was the appellant\u2019s inability to specify which regulatory body governed his medical profession. The court pointed out that the Medical Council of India regulates medical practitioners in the Allopathy branch of science, while AYUSH practitioners (Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy) have their own regulatory bodies.The court stressed the importance of protecting public health, safety, and well-being, as well as maintaining confidence in the medical profession and upholding professional standards.

The petitioners, seeking exemption from surrendering, argued that petitioner no. 1 (the appellant no. 1) had married the victim many years ago, and they have two children together. The State opposed the request, stating that the victim, during a spot inspection, had confirmed that she had married petitioner no. 1 about seven years ago and had two children with him. The State argued that the fact that they had married should not be a reason to condone the crime against the State. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court, in an order dated December 7, 2020, granted an exemption from surrendering.Following this, the Court, in an order dated December 12, 2020, directed the Karnataka State Legal Services Authority (KSLSA) to investigate the factual circumstances and the well-being of the victim.

Settlement Commissions serve as alternative dispute resolution mechanisms under Indian income tax and excise laws, offering taxpayers an alternative means of resolving disputes over dues instead of resorting to traditional litigation.A bench comprising Justices BV Nagarathna and Ujjal Bhuyan emphasized that excessive court involvement in disputes before these commissions could undermine the confidence of those who seek resolution through such means.In the interest of legislative intent, the bench urged against frequent interference with Settlement Commission orders or proceedings. It stressed that High Courts should not scrutinize Settlement Commission orders as if they were appellate courts. Altering reasoned Settlement Commission orders could diminish the trust of genuine assesses and potentially lead to unnecessary litigation when settlements are possible. This broader perspective must be considered, the bench emphasized.The Supreme Court made these remarks in the context of an appeal challenging Karnataka High Court judgments from 2012 and 2010, which had set aside a 2008 Settlement Commission order involving Kotak Mahindra Bank.In 2000, an Assessing Officer alleged that the bank had concealed its rental income. A Settlement Commission eventually determined that the bank owed over \u20b9196 crores in additional income.However, the commission waived the penalty amount and granted the bank immunity from prosecution under Section 245H(1) of the Income Tax Act, citing the bank\u2019s full and honest disclosures and cooperation in the proceedings.The High Court, however, overturned these findings, prompting the bank to appeal to the Supreme Court.The Supreme Court upheld the commission\u2019s decision to grant the bank immunity from prosecution and to waive the penalty otherwise due. The court clarified that there is no universally applicable formula and that immunity under Section 245H may be granted when the Commission is satisfied with the applicant\u2019s full and honest income disclosure and cooperation during the proceedings.Furthermore, the Supreme Court held that the High Court should not have reviewed the commission\u2019s decision regarding the sufficiency of material or particulars presented before it. These aspects fall outside the scope of judicial review.Consequently, the appeal was allowed, and the High Court\u2019s orders were set aside, reinstating the Settlement Commission\u2019s order.", "[Landmark Judgement] Gurpreet Singh v.

While dealing with the prayers addressed on this petition, the Court has borne in mind the following salient facts. Undisputedly, the petitioner is a victim of rape. She is stated to be about 13 to 17 years old. The assault on her person and the defilement of her body would have undoubtedly left scars which would take years to heal. Her misery and suffering would stand compounded even more if she were forced to bear the mantle of motherhood at such a tender age. The Court shudders to even imagine the state of despondency that would descend over her life. The mental and physical trauma that she would have to undergo if she were forced to carry the foetus and take on the onerous duties of motherhood is unimaginable. This Court is of the firm opinion that if the petitioner was forced to go through with the pregnancy despite the same having been caused on account of the incident of sexual assault, it would permanently scar her psyche and cause grave and irreparable injury to her mental health.

In this case, that\u2019s not the situation; he has served the minimum required period for the nature of the offense.\u201dJustice Kaul also expressed, \u201cLabeling the entire Tamil Nadu region as sensitive and communal due to concerns about his return to the incident location is an attempt to give it a communal coloration. I am very surprised that the State is framing it in such terms.\u201dIbrahim, the convict, had been sentenced to life imprisonment under Section 302 of the IPC and one-year rigorous imprisonment under Section 148 of the IPC. The denial of benefits was based on the Probation Officer\u2019s report, which indicated a danger to the convict\u2019s life.When his brother approached the High Court, it declined to intervene, stating that concerns about Ibrahim\u2019s safety and security were legitimate and could not be dismissed as baseless. The petitioner had argued that the convict would not return to the area in question.After a brief hearing, the Supreme Court, in its interim order, stated, \u201cWe are dealing with a situation where the petitioner(s) was 18 years old when he was incarcerated and has now spent over 24 years in custody. As per the order dated 13.12.2022, we recorded the submission of the petitioner(s)\u2019 counsel that the petitioner(s) was willing to undertake not to go to the area in question, as the reason cited was the petitioner(s)\u2019 security if released prematurely.\u201dContinuing, the Bench noted, \u201cWe may point out that the petitioner(s), who had spent 24 years and 10 months in custody at that time, had been released on 24 occasions, and the victim\u2019s family had also moved away from the incident site, with no known whereabouts. Merely because two families belonged to different religious beliefs, that should not be the reason to indefinitely keep the petitioner(s) in custody.\u201dThe Court highlighted that on March 13, 2023, senior counsel for the petitioners had expressed their willingness to relocate from that area, and they invited the State to specify which areas they should avoid. Despite the Court\u2019s inquiry, the respondent had not provided any response, nor had an affidavit been submitted.Consequently, the Court stated that they had no alternative but to summon a senior officer, not below the rank of Additional Secretary of the Department, for the next hearing. The Court also granted interim bail to Ibrahim and scheduled the next hearing for October 30, 2023.Case Title: Sikkander v. The State Rep. By Secretary To Govt. Of Tamil Nadu & Ors ", "Delhi High Court Rejects Claim that Trademark Was Inspired by Hindu Gods Citing Lack of Supporting Evidence": "LI NetworkPublished on: 28 September 2023 at 00:08 ISTThe Delhi High Court, presided over by Justice C. Hari Shankar, has dismissed the defense put forth by an Indian entity accused of trademark infringement against a German company. The defense argued that their use of the trademark was inspired by Hindu Gods \u2013 Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahesh.In its ruling, the court stated, \u201cThe \u2018Vishnu Brahma Mahesh\u2019 explanation is too simplistic to withstand legal scrutiny, and it lacks any corroborating documentary evidence.\u201dThe court further noted, \u201cIn my opinion, it is evident that the defendant has consistently intended to create confusion in the minds of consumers between the products produced by the plaintiff and other products sold under the \u2018VBM\u2019 label.\u201dThis legal dispute involved a trademark infringement case filed by a German medical equipment manufacturer named VBM Medizintechnik GMBH against Geetan Luthra, the proprietor of VBM India Co (VBMIC).The German company alleged that Luthra had violated their trademark by using the \u2018VBM\u2019 mark, which they argued stood for \u201cMr. Volker Bertram Medical.\u201d Conversely, the defendants claimed that \u2018VBM\u2019 represented \u201cVishnu, Brahma, and Mahesh.\u201dThe High Court did not accept the \u201csomewhat clever\u201d explanation for the acronym \u201cVBM\u201d and expressed the view that the defendant might have invoked divine retribution for using the holy Trinity for potentially dishonest purposes.Furthermore, the Court determined that the defendant\u2019s registration of the \u2018VMB\u2019 mark lacked good faith and could not benefit from the provisions of Section 33 of the Trade Marks Act.The Court also found that all the elements of a passing-off claim were present in this case.Consequently, the Court was convinced that by adopting \u201cVBM\u201d as part of its corporate and intellectual identity, the defendant was attempting to pass off products it dealt with as those of the plaintiff, even when they were not manufactured by the plaintiff.In this regard, the Court stated, \u201cIn this case, the defendant not only adopted a trade name and a mark identical to those of the plaintiff but also, under the same mark, marketed goods not manufactured by the plaintiff. This was done by affixing a deceptively similar mark on the goods to mislead consumers into believing they were the plaintiff\u2019s products. It is not a valid defense for the defendant to claim that it was not selling any products that directly competed with the plaintiff\u2019s under its registered \u2018VBM\u2019 logo. In both cases, the defendant was dealing in medical equipment. The screenshot provided is revealing. Clearly, the defendant\u2019s intention was to use the plaintiff\u2019s mark to deal in goods from various manufacturers, applying its deceptively similar mark to those goods.\u201dAs a result, the Court deemed it appropriate to grant the interlocutory injunction sought by the plaintiff.Case Title: VBM Medizintechnik GMBH V.

Agnihotri, whose upcoming film \u2018The Vaccine War\u2019 is scheduled for release on Thursday, has stirred controversy by suggesting that Tharoor and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal promoted foreign vaccines in exchange for financial incentives.The ongoing feud between Shashi Tharoor and Vivek Agnihotri has attracted significant attention, leaving many curious about the reasons behind Tharoor\u2019s decision to take legal action. The dispute appears to have its roots in Agnihotri\u2019s recent statements, which he made during an interview with a media outlet. In a viral clip from this interview, Agnihotri expressed his views on celebrities endorsing products for monetary gain, distinguishing between public figures and those holding constitutional positions.Agnihotri stated, \u201cIf a right-wing person promotes [Shah Rukh Khan\u2019s film] \u2018Jawaan\u2019 for some money, that\u2019s not a problem. They are just earning some money. Amitabh Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan, Aamir Khan, and cricketers like Virat Kohli promote products that they don\u2019t use and never will. That\u2019s a business give and take. But it is very concerning if people holding Constitutional posts take money to promote something against the interest of the country.\u201d In response to the interviewer\u2019s prodding, Agnihotri specifically mentioned Kejriwal and Tharoor as individuals holding constitutional positions who have allegedly engaged in such promotions.Agnihotri further claimed, \u201cWe have shown everything in the movie. Certain things are blurred in the Indian version since we cannot show those, but in the overseas version, it is all there.\u201dWhile Arvind Kejriwal has not yet responded to the viral clip, Shashi Tharoor reacted to a user\u2019s suggestion on social media that both he and the AAP leader should consider legal action against the director for making these \u201cwild allegations.\u201d Tharoor expressed his intent to seek legal counsel, stating, \u201cIt is obviously a cheap bid for publicity, but the concern is that once a lie is repeated often enough, some people will start to believe it. Am seeking legal advice.\u201dThis is not the first time that Vivek Agnihotri and Shashi Tharoor have engaged in a public dispute. They have previously clashed over Tharoor\u2019s commentary on Agnihotri\u2019s film \u2018The Kashmir Files\u2019 and Tharoor\u2019s statements on Mughals in his social media posts.

The court also directed the Tamil Nadu government to investigate systemic corruption related to land grabbing and consider enacting appropriate laws to prevent such illegal activities.The court remarked, \u201cThe necessity for legislation prohibiting land grabbing cannot be overstated. It is crucial to initiate criminal proceedings against land grabbers. Land grabbing unquestionably falls under the purview of the Indian Penal Code. The criminal aspect of land grabbing is indisputable, especially when it involves government-owned land. This is unequivocally an offense against the state.\u201dThe court further directed the authorities to investigate instances of corruption in the context of government land appropriation and urged the government to enact laws to curb such unlawful seizure of government property.The case revolved around M/s Hotel Saravana Bhavan\u2019s request for land ownership rights (patta) for a 3.45-acre plot of land situated near the Central Bus Stand in Koyembedu. The petitioner sought to use the land for constructing a shopping mall and hypermarket with an investment of Rs 1,575 crore. The land, originally allocated by the previous AIADMK government just before the 2021 Assembly election, had been revoked by the current DMK government last year.The court noted that Koyembedu is a vital area within Chennai and that the land in question is located opposite the Central Bus Stand, making it unsuitable for assignment as it would harm the public interest.Additionally, the court emphasized that the government\u2019s constitutional powers must be exercised for the public good, following principles of reasonableness and public interest. The court clarified that if the government assigns government-owned lands without satisfying these criteria, it would be unconstitutional and invalid.The court also described the case as a classic example of influential individuals in society systematically grabbing land, often with the collusion of government officials. It raised concerns about systemic violations that occur across various political landscapes, involving both bureaucracy and politicians. The court stressed that such structural corruption forms the basis for various social evils and undermines good governance.Ultimately, the court rejected the petition, asserting that the established facts and submitted documents lead to the inevitable conclusion that the petitioner was not entitled to land ownership rights (patta).Furthermore, the court directed the initiation of appropriate criminal prosecutions and disciplinary actions against individuals, including government officials and public servants, who were responsible for the unlawful appropriation of valuable government properties.Case Title: M/s.

They reaffirmed that banks have a duty to adhere to the provisions of the law, just like any other litigants.Case Overview:The case revolved around borrowers who had availed a credit facility of Rs. 100 crore from a bank. They utilized Rs. 65 crore to settle an existing LRD facility and provided a simple mortgage over a piece of land as security for the remaining Rs. 35 crore. Unfortunately, the borrowers defaulted on the loan, resulting in it being classified as a Non-Performing Asset (NPA). The bank issued a demand notice under Section 13(2) of the SARFAESI Act, seeking repayment of the principal amount, along with interest, costs, and charges, totaling Rs. 123.83 crore. Since the borrower couldn\u2019t repay, the bank decided to auction the secured asset.After several unsuccessful attempts, the bank eventually sold the asset for Rs. 105 crore, with the appellant emerging as the highest bidder and depositing the bid amount. Concurrently, the borrowers filed a redemption application before DRT-I. While awaiting the DRT\u2019s decision, they also approached the High Court, seeking permission to redeem the mortgage on the secured asset. Before the High Court, the borrowers expressed their willingness to pay Rs. 129 crore to redeem the mortgage, which the bank accepted. Consequently, the High Court permitted the borrowers to redeem the mortgage upon payment.Subsequently, the appellant, the auction winner, appealed to the Supreme Court against the High Court\u2019s order.The Supreme Court, in its ruling, held that the borrower\u2019s failure to tender the entire amount due before the publication of the auction notice, as stipulated by Section 13(8) of the SARFAESI Act, led to the \u201cextinguishment of the right of redemption of the mortgage.\u201d The Court clarified that once the Section 13(8) stage concluded and the auction was finalized, the borrower no longer retained any right of redemption under Section 13(8).Justice Pardiwala, who authored the judgment, explained:\u201cThe right of redemption is clearly restricted until the date of publication of the sale notice under the SARFAESI Act, whereas this right continues under Section 60 of the Transfer of Property Act 1882 until the execution of the conveyance of the mortgaged property.\u201dThe court further added:\u201cSuch a scenario is all the more worrisome, because the general public who participate in such auctions are often neither aware nor informed by the secured creditors conducting the auctions, that as long as the sale certificate is not issued, they will not have a right in the said asset and that the borrower whose asset is being auctioned could sweep-in and redeem the mortgage any time, and thereby thwart their rights and the very auction process.\u201dCase Title: Celir LLP v.

Kamal Narayan (1963)\u00a0Honourable Supreme Court of India has held that where there exists any inconsistency between two provisions of a same instrument / document / deed, then the former clause shall prevail over the latter one. It is held that an attempt should always be made to read the two parts of the document i.e., deed / contract etc. harmoniously, however the law of interpretation will always prefer the First Clause in the sequence over the other Inconsistent Clause of a same instrument / document / deed.12. The golden Rule of construction, it has been said, is to ascertain the intention of the parties to the instrument after considering all the words, in their ordinary, natural sense. To ascertain this intention the Court had to consider the relevant portion of the document as a whole and also to take into account the circumstances under which the particular words were used. Very often the status and the training of the parties using the words have to be taken into consideration. It has to be borne in mind that very many words are used in more than one sense and that sense differs in different circumstances. Again, even where a particular word has to a trained conveyancer a clear and definite significance and one can be sure about the sense in which such conveyancer would use it, it may not be reasonable and proper to give the same strict interpretation of the word when used by one who is not so equally skilled in the art of convincing. It is clear, however, that an attempt should always be made to read the two parts of the document harmoniously, if possible; it is only when this is not possible, e.g., where an absolute title is given is in clear and unambiguous terms and the later provisions trench on the same, that the later provisions have to be held to be void.Drafted By Abhijit Mishra", "Amendments to IT Rules Aim to Combat Fake News and Not Restrict Government Satire": "LI NetworkPublished on: 27 September 2023 at 15:57 ISTThe Central government informed the Bombay High Court during a hearing that the recent amendments to the Information Technology Rules of 2023 are aimed at controlling fake news rather than targeting satire directed at the government. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), clarified that the rules do not prohibit expressions of opinion or critical analysis of the government but are primarily intended to address the issue of false news.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta emphasized that humor or satire directed at any government is always welcomed, as long as it does not involve abuse or obscenity. He stressed that there is no intention to restrict humor or satire in any way, and the government\u2019s concern lies solely with false information, especially when disseminated through anonymous media channels.He stated, \u201cAny humor or satire against the political government\u2026 is always welcome in any manner. It cannot be proscribed. The government is only concerned with false facts going around coupled with the fact that we are dealing with anonymous media.

The petitioners, including stand-up comic Kunal Kamra, the Editors Guild of India, the Association of Indian Magazines, and the New Broadcast and Digital Association, specifically challenged Rule 3, which empowers fact-check units (FCUs) to identify and label what they consider \u2018false or fake online news\u2019 related to government activities.Mehta explained that the Rules were framed with the fundamental rights of five stakeholders in mind: the internet user, the intermediary, the recipient, the government, and the public at large. He highlighted that the Rules do not contain penal provisions and do not criminalize any content. Instead, they regulate content and resolve disputes between content senders and aggrieved parties.Mehta clarified that the FCUs would only target content related to government affairs if it is patently false, fake, or misleading, and satire or humor would not be affected.He also outlined the procedure for content regulation by FCUs, explaining that when FCUs flag content to intermediaries, the intermediaries have three options: remove the content, add a disclaimer indicating that the content has been flagged, or ignore the FCU\u2019s communication.In response to the court\u2019s question about why the amendment was necessary if intermediaries were not mandated to comply with FCU communications, Mehta stated that any aggrieved party could take an intermediary to court, and the court would ultimately determine the veracity of the content.Mehta added that the amendment was crucial because it prevented intermediaries from hiding behind the \u2018safe harbor\u2019 protection under Section 79 of the Information Technology Act while conducting business and earning substantial profits.", "Bombay HC: Epilepsy No Grounds for Divorce Under Hindu Marriage Act": "LI NetworkPublished on: 27 September 2023 at 15:00 ISTThe Bombay High Court has delivered a significant ruling, stating that epilepsy is not a valid ground for seeking divorce under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 [Harish @ Roshan Karnewar vs Leelavati @ Reena Karnewar].In this case, a division bench consisting of Justices Vinay Joshi and Valmiki SA Menezes upheld a 2016 family court decision denying divorce to a man who claimed that his wife\u2019s epilepsy constituted an incurable disease and rendered her unsound of mind. The husband asserted that his wife\u2019s epilepsy led to abnormal behavior, including suicide threats, which ultimately resulted in the breakdown of their marriage.Also Read: All you need to know about Divorce Law in India \u2013 Law Insider IndiaHowever, the High Court disagreed with these allegations, emphasizing that epilepsy is neither an incurable disease nor a mental or psychopathic disorder, making it an insufficient ground for divorce under Section 13(1)(iii) of the Hindu Marriage Act.The bench referenced and endorsed the findings of a single judge in the case of Raghunath Gopal Daftardar V. Vijaya Raghunath Daftardar, indicating that while not identical, the reasoning applied to the current case. Additionally, the bench noted that there is substantial medical evidence confirming that epilepsy does not prevent spouses from living together.The Court highlighted that the husband failed to establish that his wife suffered from epilepsy or that such a condition could serve as a ground for divorce under Section 13(1)(iii) of the Act. According to a neurologist who treated the wife, she experienced a brain seizure rather than epilepsy.Furthermore, the Court emphasized that even if the wife had epilepsy, it would not constitute a mental disorder, psychopathic disorder, or render her incurably unsound of mind. Consequently, the husband\u2019s claim of cruelty or mental torture due to the wife\u2019s condition lacked a basis.The Court also dismissed the husband\u2019s argument that the wife had written a suicide threat letter due to her \u201cabnormal\u201d behavior. It was determined that she wrote the note under duress from her husband, fearing eviction from their matrimonial home, and only to protect her one-year-old daughter.", "SC: Material Disclosed to Income Tax Settlement Commission Should Not Be Different from What Was Discovered by AO": "LI NetworkPublished on: 27 September 2023 at 14:37 ISTThe Supreme Court of India clarified that Section 245H of the Income Tax Act, 1961, which grants the Income Tax Settlement Commission the authority to provide immunity from prosecution and penalties to taxpayers who fully and truthfully disclose their income, does not impose an artificial requirement that the material disclosed to the Commission must be distinct from what was already discovered by the Assessing Officer.The ruling came as a response to a case involving Kotak Mahindra Bank, which had approached the Settlement Commission seeking to settle its income tax liabilities. The Assessing Officer had previously issued a notice for the reassessment of the bank\u2019s income, along with a penalty order for alleged income concealment.The Settlement Commission, while upholding the bank\u2019s application for settlement, granted immunity from penalty and prosecution under Section 245H(1) of the Act, and annulled the penalty levied by the Assessing Officer. However, the Revenue Department challenged this decision, leading to a legal battle.The Karnataka High Court set aside the order granting immunity, stating that the reasoning behind the Settlement Commission\u2019s decision was vague and unsound. The High Court believed that the bank should have proven that it had not concealed income or acted willfully to neglect it. Consequently, the case was remanded to the Settlement Commission for reconsideration.The Supreme Court, in its analysis, highlighted that Section 245H(1) allows the Settlement Commission to grant immunity when the taxpayer has cooperated and made a full and true disclosure of income. While Section 245C specifies that the disclosure must include income \u201cnot disclosed before the Assessing Officer,\u201d the Court emphasized that it does not necessitate that the disclosed material be entirely distinct from what the Assessing Officer had discovered.The Court asserted that the purpose of Chapter-XIXA of the Act is to facilitate settlements and reduce disputes, rather than prolonging litigation. Taxpayers can approach the Settlement Commission by offering to tax additional income beyond what was initially reported, thereby resolving cases more efficiently.The Supreme Court concluded that the Settlement Commission had made a valid decision based on relevant facts and material, considering the bank\u2019s unique circumstances, such as complying with RBI guidelines. Therefore, it set aside the High Court\u2019s order, restoring the Commission\u2019s original decision to grant immunity to Kotak Mahindra Bank.In essence, the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling clarifies that the Settlement Commission\u2019s discretionary powers should not be restricted by the requirement that disclosed material must differ from what the Assessing Officer had found. This decision upholds the principles of efficient tax settlement and aims to minimize prolonged litigation.", "Gujarat HC: No Automatic Heritage Status for Old British-Era Properties": "LI NetworkPublished on: 27 September 2023 at 13:43 ISTThe Gujarat High Court, during a hearing on Tuesday, emphasized that not all old properties from the British era can be automatically classified as heritage structures. This observation came in response to a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed seeking protection for the 121-year-old structure known as Pushpakoot, who was the former residence of Indian cricketer Vijay Hazare.The bench, consisting of Chief Justice Sunita Agarwal and Justice Aniruddha Mayee, pointed out that the petitioner trust had not conducted any research to establish whether the bungalow, where Hazare lived for nearly four decades, qualified as a heritage structure or one protected under the Gujarat Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1965.The court criticized the petitioner trust for bringing the matter to court solely based on a \u201cnewspaper report\u201d suggesting that the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) might demolish the structure.The Chief Justice emphasized that merely making a few representations to the authorities would not suffice if the petitioner was genuinely interested in preserving such properties, and it should be more like a comprehensive movement. The court\u2019s observation stemmed from the fact that the petitioner had taken no action to protect the structure before the news report of its impending demolition.Furthermore, the court clarified that it was not within the petitioner\u2019s purview to request the government to declare someone\u2019s property as a heritage site, as there is a specific procedure for such determinations.The bench also inquired about whether the structure had been documented in any book or possessed historical significance, but the counsel representing the petitioner could not provide clear answers.Consequently, the bench adjourned the matter until October 4, giving the petitioners time to provide the necessary evidence or documentation.", "Supreme Court Refers NN Global Case to Determine the Enforceability of Arbitration Clauses in Unstamped Agreements": "LI NetworkPublished on: 27 September 2023 at 13:11 ISTThe Supreme Court has decided to refer the crucial issue of whether unstamped or insufficiently stamped arbitration agreements are enforceable.

The five-judge bench, led by Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud, took this step in response to the curative petition and the 2020 ruling\u2019s implications.The curative petition raised concerns about the validity of the judgment delivered by a five-judge bench earlier in 2023 in the case of M/s. N.N. Global Mercantile Pvt. Ltd. v. M/s. Indo Unique Flame Ltd. And Ors. In the NN Global case, a bench comprising Justice K.M. Joseph, Justice Ajay Rastogi, Justice Aniruddha Bose, Justice Hrishikesh Roy, and Justice C.T. Ravikumar had addressed the issue by a majority of 3:2. The majority opinion held that an unstamped instrument could not be considered a legally enforceable contract under Section 2(h) of the Contract Act.During the recent proceedings, the bench acknowledged that this was a matter of great significance and had led to significant uncertainty in arbitration law, particularly concerning older agreements that were now being challenged due to insufficient stamping. As a result, the bench concluded that a larger bench of seven judges should consider the matter. The bench stated:\u201cHaving regard to the larger ramifications and the view of the majority in NN Global, we are of the considered view that the proceedings should be placed before a seven-judge bench. The proceedings shall be listed for hearing on 11 October 2023.\u201dMr. Debesh Panda and Ms. Pritha Srikumar were appointed as the nodal counsels in this case, and all relevant documents were ordered to be submitted by October 6, 2023.

Conversely, Senior Advocate Shyam Divan, representing the respondent, argued that the case pertained to a 1997 agreement, and nothing substantive remained to be addressed. Divan further urged the bench not to reopen factual issues and not to consider the legal issue in the present reference.Chief Justice DY Chandrachud assured Divan that the bench would hear his arguments on the matter\u2019s maintainability at a later stage before the seven-judge bench. He emphasized the importance of addressing the correctness of the judgment in NN Global, stating that it was a matter of great significance and that the hearing would not be delayed.", "Supreme Court Awards Rs 1.5 Crore Compensation to Air Veteran Infected with HIV During Blood Transfusion": "LI NetworkPublished on: 27 September 2023 at 13:11 ISTIn a landmark decision that underscores the principles of safeguarding the dignity, rights, and well-being of armed forces personnel, the Supreme Court has ruled in favor of a retired Air Veteran, finding the Indian Air Force (IAF) and the Indian Army jointly and vicariously liable for medical negligence.

All arrears related to disability pension shall be disbursed within 6 weeks.\u201dFurthermore, the Supreme Court, in its extensive judgment, not only addressed the specific case but also issued significant directives related to the HIV Act, 2017. The case was heard by a bench comprising Justices S Ravindra Bhat and Dipankar Datta, as the appellant challenged a judgment from the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC), which had denied his compensation claim for contracting HIV due to medical negligence.The case revolved around allegations of negligence by the respondents, which resulted in the appellant contracting HIV. While serving on duty under \u201cOperation Parakram\u201d in Jammu & Kashmir, he fell ill and was admitted to 171 Military Hospital, Samba, in July 2002, where he received a blood transfusion during treatment. In 2014, he became ill again, and HIV was diagnosed.The appellant sought information regarding the Personal Occurrence Report (POR) related to his hospitalization in July 2002, and his Medical Case Sheet was provided. Subsequently, Medical Boards in 2014 and 2015 determined that his disability was attributable to service due to the blood transfusion in July 2002.The appellant was discharged from service on May 31, 2016, without an extension. When he requested a disability certificate, it was denied, citing a lack of provision for such a certificate.Discontented with this response, he approached the NCDRC, seeking compensation of 95 crores.The NCDRC ruled that \u201cIn the present case, there is no Expert Opinion to the effect that at the time of blood transfusion in the body of the complainant, the staff of 171 Military Hospital had committed any negligence. As such, the complaint is liable to be dismissed on this short ground alone.\u201dIn response, the air veteran (appellant) brought the case to the Supreme Court.Duty to Protect the Lives of Armed Forces PersonnelThe Supreme Court emphasized the paramount importance of upholding the dignity and well-being of armed forces personnel.The Court remarked, \u201cPeople sign up to join the armed forces with considerable enthusiasm and a sense of patriotic duty. This entails a conscious decision to put their lives on the line and be prepared for the ultimate sacrifice of their lives. A corresponding duty is cast on all state functionaries, including echelons of power within the armed forces, to ensure that the highest standards of safety, both physical and mental well-being, as well as wellness, are maintained. This is the minimum required of the military airforce employer for not only ensuring the morale of forces but also showing a sense of how much such personnel matter and that their lives count, which reinforces their commitment and confidence. Any flouting of these standards, as the multiple instances in the present case have established, only entails a loss of confidence in personnel, undermines their morale, and injects a sense of bitterness and despair not only in the individual but throughout the entire force, leaving a sense of injustice.\u201dThe Court further noted, \u201cWhen a young person from either sex, as is nowadays the case, enrolls/joins any armed forces, at all times their expectation is to be treated with dignity and honor.\u201dUnfortunately, the Court observed that the respondents\u2019 behavior consistently lacked the fundamental principles of dignity, honor, and compassion. It remarked, \u201cThe present case has demonstrated again and again how dignity, honor, and compassion toward the appellant were completely lacking in the respondents\u2019 behavior. Repeatedly, the court places disdain, discrimination, and even a hint of stigma attached to the appellant in the attitude of the respondent.\u201dThe judgment concluded by acknowledging that no amount of compensation could fully heal the wounds inflicted by such behavior. It recognized, \u201cAlthough this court has attempted to give tangible relief at the end of the day, it realizes that no amount of compensation and monetary terms can undo the harm caused by such behavior, which has shaken the foundation of the appellant\u2019s dignity, robbed him of honor, and rendered him not only desperate but cynical.\u201dThe Court expressed gratitude to the amicus curiae Senior Advocate Ms. Meenakshi Arora for her valuable assistance, as well as to ASG Vikramjeet Banerjee. The Court also commended the efforts of Advocate Ms. Vanshaja Shukla, the amicus curiae in the matter, for her meticulous compilation of documents and her dedication to addressing all concerns. Notably, the appellant represented himself in the case.Furthermore, the Court imposed a cost of 5 lakhs on the respondents and allowed the appeal. It directed the Supreme Court Legal Services Committee to pay Rs 50,000 to Advocate Vanshaja Shukla for her efforts.", "Supreme Court: Verification must be done Before Issuing New Aadhaar Cards to Displaced Individuals in Manipur": "LI NetworkPublished on: 27 September 2023 at 12:22 ISTExpressing apprehension about potential misuse of Aadhaar cards by illegal migrants, the Supreme Court has instructed the Deputy Director General of the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) in Gauhati and the home secretary of Manipur to conduct thorough verification before issuing new Aadhaar cards to displaced individuals residing in camps in Manipur.Advocate Vibha Makhija, representing the court-appointed committee, conveyed to the three-judge bench, led by Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud, the need to issue Aadhaar cards to those who have lost them, seeking court directives for the same.In response, the bench emphasized the importance of verification before Aadhaar issuance to prevent misuse by unauthorized immigrants. They expressed their inability to issue blanket orders for this purpose.Consequently, the bench directed, \u201cThe Deputy DG, UIDAI, regional office Gauhati, and state home secretary shall take all steps to ensure that Aadhaar cards are provided to all displaced persons who may have lost their Aadhaar cards in the process of displacement. We clarify that UIDAI, which would have bio-metric data of enrolled persons, would match the claims of any displaced persons, and then issue the Aadhaar cards.\u201dAdvocate Makhija also raised concerns about displaced individuals encountering difficulties in accessing their bank accounts due to the destruction of relevant documents during communal violence.The court issued two additional directives to the finance and health secretaries of Manipur. The Finance department was tasked with instructing all banks in the state to provide displaced individuals with details of their bank accounts. Simultaneously, the Manipur health secretary was instructed to facilitate the issuance of disability certificates to differently-abled individuals in relief camps.Furthermore, the bench called upon the Union Home Ministry to designate a nodal officer in Delhi responsible for receiving and redirecting complaints and grievances to the appropriate authority in Manipur. ", "Delhi HC: Inappropriate and Derogatory Language in Legal Pleadings Unacceptable": "LI NetworkPublished on: 27 September 2023 at 12:13 ISTThe Delhi High Court has asserted that the use of inappropriate and derogatory language in legal pleadings undermines the dignity of individuals and goes beyond the acceptable bounds of language expected in such documents.The Court resolved a Criminal Petition challenging the bail order granted by the Trial Court to the Respondent. While acknowledging that strong language may sometimes be necessary for the pursuit of justice, the Court stressed that legal practitioners should always maintain a dignified tone and avoid crossing the line into offensiveness.Justice Swarana Kanta Sharma noted, \u201cHaving gone through the contents of the counter-affidavit filed on record on behalf of accused/respondent no. 2, this Court is of the opinion that the use of inappropriate and derogatory language, undermining the dignity of individuals, based on their gender, falls beyond the permissible bounds of language expected in legal pleadings.\u201d\u201cThe use of inappropriate language, which diminishes the character of a woman and implies that her marital status makes her less of a person or a woman, and that the marital status of the man in question entitles him to a virgin woman and an unmarried person, goes beyond being derogatory and is an affront to the principles of equality, dignity, and respect,\u201d the Court noted.The Petitioner, a single businesswoman with two children, filed an FIR under Sections 376 and 506 of the Indian Penal Code, alleging rape and cheating by Respondent no. 2 on false marriage pretenses. However, the Trial Court granted bail to Respondent no. 2, leading the Petitioner to file a Criminal Petition challenging the bail order.The Court clarified that when granting or denying bail, the courts are obligated to issue reasoned orders but are not required to decide the case\u2019s merits. It emphasized that offering a definitive opinion on the merits of a case at the stage of granting anticipatory bail, especially when investigations are ongoing and evidence has yet to be collected by the prosecution, sets a risky precedent.The Court reviewed the Counter Affidavit submitted by Respondent no. 2 and observed that it contained inappropriate and offensive language. It highlighted the importance of using gender-sensitive language in all legal documents. In this context, the Court referred to the Supreme Court\u2019s \u2018Handbook on Combating Gender Stereotypes,\u2019 emphasizing that legal practitioners must be mindful of the language they use in their documents, refraining from employing derogatory, offensive, or gender-stereotyped language.The Court emphasized that lawyers may use strong language to present their clients\u2019 cases, but this should not excuse the use of offensive, abusive, disrespectful, derogatory, or misogynistic language. While strong language may sometimes be necessary to pursue justice, it should always maintain a dignified tone and avoid crossing into offensiveness.The Court issued specific guidelines, including the addition of paragraphs in orders/judgments to clarify that they do not express the Court\u2019s opinion on the case\u2019s merits. These guidelines aim to prevent any confusion at the final disposal of the case.The Court found no valid grounds for canceling anticipatory bail in the impugned order and thus disposed of the Petition.Case Title: Rajan Devi v State (Govt. of NCT of Delhi) & Anr", "Karnataka HC: Caste Certificate Not a Barrier to Address Fraudulent Claims": "LI NetworkPublished on: 27 September 2023 at 12:11 ISTThe Karnataka High Court has clarified that a caste certificate should not be treated as an insurmountable barrier against addressing fraudulent claims. It can be revoked through the appropriate legal proceedings if it was obtained through fraudulent means.This decision came in an intra-court appeal challenging a Single Judge\u2019s order regarding a writ petition. The Single Judge\u2019s order had canceled an inquiry into the petitioner\u2019s social status, citing the issuance of a Validity Certificate by the District Verification Committee. The petitioner was satisfied with the cancellation of the inquiry, It was objected to the part of the order reserving the right for a future inquiry \u201cin the event of any irregularity in the petitioner\u2019s caste, this order will not come in the way of any action that may be initiated in accordance with the law.\u201dA Division Bench consisting of Chief Justice Prasanna B. Varale and Justice Krishna S. Dixit emphasized that if a social status certificate is acquired through fraudulent means, it can be revoked through the appropriate legal process by the authorities. Therefore, a Validity Certificate should not be seen as an impervious obstacle preventing any action from being taken.The appellant\u2019s counsel argued against the granted liberty, while the Additional Government Advocate representing the respondents contended that authorities have the discretion to initiate action under the Karnataka Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Other Backward Classes (Reservation of Appointment, etc.) Act, 1990, and its related rules, even without such explicit reservation.After hearing both sides and reviewing the appeal documents, the Court declined to interfere in the matter, concurring with the stance of the Additional Government Advocate. The Court noted that when a social status certificate is obtained unlawfully, through fraud, or granted by mistake, legal proceedings are generally permitted under the provisions of the 1990 Act and the accompanying regulations, subject to just exceptions. Considering these factors, the appeal was found to lack merit and was dismissed, with costs awarded to the respondents.Case Title: Satish Choudappa Honnali v.

It is duly held Section 159 Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 empowers the Magistrate to hold the investigation or preliminary enquiry of the offence either himself or through the Magistrate subordinate to him. It is held that Section 159 CrPC is designed to keep the Magistrate informed of the investigation so as to enable him to control investigation and, if necessary, to give appropriate direction.28. Thus, from the above it is evident that the Criminal Procedure Code provides for internal and external checks : one of them being the receipt of a copy of the FIR by the Magistrate concerned. It serves the purpose that the FIR be not ante-timed or ante-dated. The Magistrate must be immediately informed of every serious offence so that he may be in a position to act under Section 159 CrPC, if so required. Section 159 CrPC empowers the Magistrate to hold the investigation or preliminary enquiry of the offence either himself or through the Magistrate subordinate to him.

Commissioner of Income-Tax (2007)Hon\u2019ble High Court of Gauhati has held that a \u201cPartnership Firm\u201d can become a partner cum shareholder of an another \u201cPartnership Firm\u201d. It is further held that Partnership Firm who is a Partner in another \u201cPartnership Firm\u201d will enjoy the benefits of exemption of Income Tax under aegis of Section 10(2) of the Income Tax Act, 1963.27. This anomalous and illogical consequence has arisen because of refusal to consider M/s. Radha Krishna Jalan, the appellant firm as a partner of the main partnership firm M/s. Rook International for the limited purpose of section 10(2A) of the Income-tax Act, 1961. This is evidently not only contrary to the facts available on record, but also to the scheme of the Income-tax Act as well as the principles of diversion of income by overriding title. This refusal has ended in double taxation. The legal fiction created for non-application of the provisions of section 10(2A) on the ground that the appellant firm is not a partner of the main partnership has ushered in an absurd situation contrary to the facts as well as the provisions of the Act. The note of discord has to be tuned with the legislative intent as reflected in the scheme of the Act. To obviate this absurdity, we hold that a sub-partnership which is in receipt of the share of profit of a partner in the main partnership, has to be deemed to be a partner in the main partnership for the limited purpose of section 10(2A). Else, the absurdity will continue. The contention of the Revenue that the appellant firm not being a partner of the main partnership will not be entitled to the benefit of section 10(2A) is not accepted for the reason that it is totally in disharmony with the scheme of the Act. For the reasons above, we answer the questions formulated in both the appeals in favour of the assessee and against the Revenue. Consequently, we set aside the order dated, 17th September, 2003 passed by the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal, Guwahati Bench, Guwahati in I.T.A.

Simultaneously, the court firmly expressed that the unruly and aggressive behavior of an advocate not only diminishes the majesty of the court but also disrupts its decorum, an unacceptable conduct is what that cannot be tolerated.This pronouncement came during the court\u2019s consideration of a petition seeking direction for the State to pay compensation and exemplary damages for the unnatural death of the petitioner\u2019s son while in police custody.Justice S.K. Panigrahi, presiding over a Single Judge Bench, remarked that \u201cThe conduct of Mr. Bahali, learned counsel is totally unbecoming of an Advocate and it prima facie makes out a strong case for criminal contempt punishable under Section 14 of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, read with Article 215 of the Constitution of India.\u201dAfter evaluating the submissions, the Bench examined the reply from the ASI of Police, which revealed that they had traveled by train from Mumbai to Kolkata with the victim minor girl and the deceased boy, who had not been arrested by the police. Instead, he was traveling with them upon the request of his elder brother, who stated that his brother would accompany them.Given that the circumstances surrounding the boy\u2019s death remained enigmatic and that the petitioner had not received a copy of the FIR even after its registration, the Bench instructed the State to produce the FIR\u2019s copy during the next hearing.The Bench took note of a heated argument between both counsels within the courtroom, marked by the exchange of abusive language and raised voices, ultimately escalating to one advocate attempting to physically confront the other, causing a disruption in the court proceedings.Despite the Bench\u2019s attempts to intervene and urge both counsels to preserve the sanctity and harmonious atmosphere of the court, one of the advocates persisted in his aggressive conduct and expressed disregard for any potential court action.In response to this misconduct, the High Court determined that such behavior by an advocate towards the court undermines the court\u2019s sanctity and obstructs its smooth functioning.Consequently, the court referred the matter to the appropriate authority for action in accordance with the law.Case Title: Basanti Puhan v.

The first respondent thereupon preferred an appeal to the Calcutta High Court, which set aside the judgment and decree of the trial court and declared that the first respondent was entitled to realise his dues from the properties which had been attached in the second execution case. The main findings of the High Court were as follows:(1) that the kobala was not a genuine but a sham transaction;(2) that the appellant had no money of his own and the sum which had been received from the insurance company belonged to his father, the second respondent;(3) that the properties in question were worth very much more than the sum of Rs 12,000 which was stated to be the consideration for the kobala; and(4) that the course of litigation and the repeated attempts made by the second respondent to obstruct and defeat the first respondent\u2019s application for execution, supported the view that the kobala was the last manoeuvre adopted by the second respondent in the course of the fight to defeat the claim of the first respondent.Drafted By Abhijit Mishra", "SC Directs SpiceJet to Pay $1 Million Monthly to Credit Suisse for Six Months to Settle Long-Standing Debts": "LI NetworkPublished on: 26 September 2023 at 17:01 ISTThe Supreme Court has issued a directive to SpiceJet, instructing the airline to make monthly payments of $1 million to Credit Suisse for a duration of six months in order to settle long-standing financial obligations.

According to the court, for such confessions to be considered admissible, two crucial conditions must be met: the individual must be accused of an offense, and they must be in police custody at the time the confession is made.The court emphasized that both \u201cbeing in the custody of a police officer\u201d and \u201cbeing accused of an offense\u201d are essential prerequisites for rendering a confession made to the police admissible, as outlined in Section 27 of the Evidence Act.Also Read: Evidentiary value of Judicial and Extra Judicial Confessions \u2013 Law Insider IndiaA three-judge bench, comprising Justices BR Gavai, JB Pardiwala, and Sanjay Kumar, was hearing an appeal related to a case from the Madhya Pradesh High Court. The High Court had upheld the conviction of Omprakash Yadav, sentencing him to life imprisonment, and had handed the death penalty to Raja Yadav and Rajesh Yadav for their involvement in the kidnapping and murder of a 15-year-old boy.Omprakash Yadav was convicted under Section 364A read with Section 120B of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), while Raja Yadav and Rajesh Yadav were found guilty under Section 302 IPC read with Section 120B and Section 364A read with Section 120B, respectively.The Supreme Court examined the circumstances surrounding the confession made by Rajesh Yadav, noting that the police had recorded his statement without formally arresting him. Consequently, at that point, he was not legally considered an \u201caccused of an offense.\u201d It was contested that confession on discovery of the deceased\u2019s body was made.The Court referred to Section 26 of the Indian Evidence Act, which stipulates that \u201cno confession made by any person whilst he is in the custody of a police officer shall be proved against such person unless it is made in the immediate presence of a Magistrate.\u201dFurthermore, Section 27 of the same act, which acts as an exception to Section 26, states that \u201cwhen any fact is deposed to as discovered in consequence of information received from a person accused of any offense, in the custody of a police officer, so much of such information, whether it amounts to a confession or not, as relates distinctly to the fact thereby discovered, may be proved.\u201dThe Court cited the Bodhraj case, emphasizing the reliability of information disclosed by a prisoner in custody. It clarified that such information becomes inadmissible under Section 26 of the Evidence Act if it does not come from a person in \u201ccustody of a police officer.\u201dThe Court also referenced the David Rozario case, reinforcing that information admissible under Section 27 of the Evidence Act becomes inadmissible if it does not come from a person in \u201ccustody of a police officer.\u201dIn the Ashish Jain case, the Court highlighted that an involuntary confessional statement of the accused is not admissible under Article 20(3) of the Constitution of India. However, if such evidence leads to the recovery of material objects related to a crime, it may be considered evidentiary.The Court underscored the crucial conditions of being \u201caccused of any offense\u201d and being in \u201cpolice custody\u201d to invoke Section 27 of the Evidence Act, as reaffirmed in the Boby case.In the case under consideration, Rajesh Yadav could not be deemed to be in \u201cpolice custody\u201d until his formal arrest, as he was not mentioned as an \u201caccused\u201d in the FIR and was not \u201caccused of any offense\u201d until his arrest. Consequently, his confession made before being accused could not be admitted as evidence under Section 27 of the Evidence Act, even if it led to the discovery of relevant facts.This ruling serves as a significant clarification of the conditions necessary for the admissibility of confessions made to the police under Section 27 of the Evidence Act.", "Bombay HC Upholds Father\u2019s Right to Custody of Minor Child Citing No Legal Bar": "LI NetworkPublished on: 26 September 2023 at 16:42 ISTThe Bombay High Court has granted custody of a minor child, born out of a relationship between an adult man and a minor woman, to the child\u2019s biological father.

The petitioner alleged that respondent number 3\u2019s family threatened them during her pregnancy, leading them to flee. However, they were eventually found and brought back by their families. Subsequently, a police complaint was filed by respondent number 3\u2019s family, and she surrendered custody of the child to respondent number 2. She also entered into marriage with another man. In response, the petitioner filed a writ petition seeking the production of his minor son and custody.The Child Welfare Committee (CWC) submitted an affidavit stating that respondent number 3 had voluntarily given up her child by signing the necessary documents. After the mandated 60-day waiting period specified in the Juvenile Justice Act (JJ Act), the child becomes eligible for adoption. The affidavit further noted that the child was available for adoption through the Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA).The court acknowledged that the petitioner was indeed the biological father of the child. However, due to respondent number 3\u2019s age, the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (POCSO Act) was invoked, leading to the petitioner\u2019s arrest. During this period, the child lived with both the petitioner and respondent number 3 for over three months. The CWC had already granted custody of the child to the petitioner under the JJ Act, following an order referring to an application filed by the petitioner\u2019s parents. This application had been misplaced by the CWC. The petitioner contended that his parents had applied for custody on his behalf while he was in custody.The court observed that this demonstrated the petitioner\u2019s and his parents\u2019 unwavering efforts to regain custody of the child.In light of these circumstances, the court disposed of the petition.Case Title: Ramu Maruti Gadivdar V. The State of Maharashtra", "Madhya Pradesh HC Proposes Using WhatsApp Groups for Witness Summons and Protection": "LI NetworkPublished on: 26 September 2023 at 15:50 ISTThe Madhya Pradesh High Court, Gwalior Bench, has suggested to the Director General of Police (DGP) and Director of Prosecution the idea of creating WhatsApp groups with a dual purpose: summoning witnesses and safeguarding their well-being.The court addressed this suggestion while adjudicating two criminal cases, one of which involved a Section 482 CrPC petition filed by the applicant, seeking a directive to the Trial Court for the expeditious conclusion of proceedings related to a case pending before the Special Judge.Justice Anand Pathak, presiding over a Single Bench, remarked, \u201c\u2026 in the considered opinion of this Court, Investigation (Police), Prosecution (District Prosecution Officer), and Adjudication (Trial Court) shall rise to the occasion and shall ensure the presence of private/official witnesses without any delay, and Senior Officers of the department shall cooperate in this regard. It is earnestly believed by this Court that Director General of Police and Director, Prosecution shall seriously take a workshop and suggestion from police officers and other experts to think of creating the concept of WhatsApp Groups for the twin purpose of summoning the witnesses and protection of witnesses.\u201dCase Background:The petitioner was the informant/complainant/victim in a case involving the murder of his son. An FIR was filed on his behalf, leading to the registration of a case under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and the M.P. Dakaiti Aur Vyapharan Prabhavit Kshetra Adhiniyam, 1981 (MPDVPK Act). The police conducted an investigation, apprehending and arresting the accused persons. After the investigation concluded, a charge-sheet was filed before the Special Court established under the MPDVPK Act. Charges were framed for various offenses.Out of the five accused persons, three were juveniles, and one was ordered to be tried as an adult. As more than four years had passed and all eyewitnesses had been examined before the Trial Court, only official and formal witnesses remained to be examined. The petitioner filed the petition due to the case\u2019s delay caused by the non-appearance of some witnesses.Court\u2019s Observations:The court highlighted that delays in summoning witnesses often harm the prosecution\u2019s case, as witnesses may be threatened, influenced, or lured to turn hostile. Communication gaps can also arise when witness summonses issued by the Trial Court do not reach the witnesses, a task that may seem less important for the police.In light of these concerns, the court proposed using WhatsApp groups as a practical solution to ensure timely witness summons and cooperation by officers in their depositions before the Trial Court.The court emphasized that privacy and dignity must be maintained within these WhatsApp groups, ensuring that they serve as tools for facilitating trials rather than for other purposes. The court stressed that these suggestions were illustrative and not exhaustive.Additionally, the court encouraged the incorporation of any effective suggestions from police officers that help conclude trials seamlessly while protecting witness privacy and identity.The court concluded by emphasizing the duty of District Prosecution Officers, the Director of Prosecution, the Superintendent of Police, and the Inspector General to ensure the prompt attendance of official witnesses in trials to expedite proceedings.Ultimately, the High Court allowed the petitions.Case Title: Vijendra Singh Sikarwar v.

He presented documents and pictures that were allegedly leaked to the media and stated that Singhal is currently in custody as part of an Enforcement Directorate case, and only the anti-money laundering agency can explain how the pictures were leaked.However, Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul remarked that the allegations against Singhal are very serious, making it a challenging juncture for the court to consider granting her bail.Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia questioned whether the privacy breach alone entitled Singhal to bail, to which Luthra responded that there were other grounds for seeking bail, and he was bringing the recent privacy breach incident to the court\u2019s attention.Advocate Zoheb Hossain, representing the Enforcement Directorate, contended that there was no breach of privacy and explained that the pictures in question were derived from CCTV footage, showing Singhal moving around in the hospital corridor. He asserted that Singhal had sufficient influence to meet family members at unconventional visiting hours and wander freely in the corridor.The bench then inquired about the progress of witness examinations, to which Hossain revealed that four witnesses had been examined, while the examination of 19 witnesses was pending, with a total of 33 witnesses expected in the case.The Supreme Court scheduled the matter for further hearing on October 30 and requested Additional Solicitor General SV Raju and Hossain to provide a list of key witnesses.Raju expressed the Enforcement Directorate\u2019s intention to file a response to Singhal\u2019s plea and raised concerns about the legibility of Singhal\u2019s medical records attached to the petition, suggesting that independent verification may be necessary.Pooja Singhal has been in custody since May 11, 2022, following raids on properties associated with her in connection with a money laundering case related to alleged corruption in the implementation of MGNREGA, a flagship rural employment scheme.

This decision has significant implications as it allows all candidates who appeared for the NEET-PG to participate in the counseling process.The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare took the decision to reduce the qualifying percentile to zero for NEET PG 2023 counseling across all categories. This move, while aimed at addressing the ongoing admission session, has sparked criticism from various quarters. Critics argue that this change may lead to less academically qualified medical students securing seats in specialized postgraduate courses, potentially affecting public health standards.A notice issued by the Medical Counselling Committee (MCC), Directorate of Health Services, Government of India, confirmed the reduction of the qualifying percentile. The notice stated, \u201cIt is for the information to candidates that the qualifying percentile for PG Courses (Medical/Dental) for NEET PG counseling 2023 has been reduced to \u2018zero\u2019 across all categories by MoHFW.\u201dThe matter was brought before the Supreme Court and mentioned for urgent listing before a bench headed by Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud.

Anil Kumar Verma (1995)\u00a0Honourable Supreme Court of India has held that publication with a malicious intent to defraud the Hon\u2019ble Court is tantamount to the interference with administration of justice. It is held that if a fabricated document is filed before the Hon\u2019ble Court then it would fall within the definition of Contempt of Court.14. The legal position thus is that if the publication be with intent to deceive the court or one made with an intention to defraud, the same would be contempt, as it would interfere with administration of justice. It would, in any case, tend to interfere with the same. This would definitely be so if a fabricated document is filed with the aforesaid mens rea. In the case at hand the fabricated document was apparently to deceive the court; the intention to defraud is writ large.

In a significant ruling, the court declared that a history sheet can only be initiated when the authority is reasonably convinced that the person in question is a habitual offender.Justice M A Chowdhary stressed that authorities must exercise this discretion with reason and justice, basing their decisions on established legal procedures rather than personal opinions or whims. The court emphasized that their actions should avoid arbitrary, vague, or fanciful judgments.\u201cThe criteria for opening a history sheet is the subjective satisfaction of the authority and it has to be arrived at, on the reasonable belief or knowledge that the person, for whom the history is opened or retained is habitually addicted or aid or abet, the commission of crime, whether convicted or not, etc\u2026The discretion of the authorities has to be exercised, according to the rules of reason and justice and not according to private opinion, according to law and not humor. It is to be not arbitrarily vague, fanciful, but legal and regular and it must be exercised within the limit to which an honest man competent to discharge his office or to confine himself.\u201dThe case originated when a petitioner sought the quashing of a \u2018Verification of Character and Antecedents Certificate\u2019 that labeled him as a history-sheeter and under surveillance as of November 19, 2022. The petitioner, a prominent politician who had contested State Legislative Assembly Elections in 2014, argued that this categorization was unwarranted and detrimental to his reputation.The petitioner contended that several cases had been registered against him, primarily out of political vendetta, but most had resulted in acquittals. Therefore, the certificate branding him as a history-sheeter was unjust and needed to be invalidated.However, the respondents argued that the petitioner had been involved in numerous criminal cases, including serious offenses like theft and rape, making him a threat to public order. They maintained that his history sheet had been initiated to monitor his activities and prevent further criminal acts.Justice Chowdhary highlighted that Rule 702 of the Police Rules, 1960, stipulates that the opening of a history sheet should be a meticulous and reasoned process, typically made by experienced officers. Justice emphasized that the decision should not be mechanical but deliberate, grounded in reasonable grounds.The court emphasized that law enforcement agencies must exercise this power with caution and responsibility, taking into account constitutional rights, particularly the right to privacy guaranteed under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution.\u201cNeedless to say that every person wants to live with dignity and he/she cannot be condemned arbitrarily. It is also to be borne in mind that estrangement of the members of the history sheeted person in social gathering etc., is not uncommon in order in our society. Therefore, opening or retention of history sheets, which interferes with the right of privacy of a person, should be done strictly, adhering to parameters inbuilt in the police rules, keeping in mind the object sought to be achieved.\u201dIn light of the fact that the petitioner had been acquitted in four out of five cases, and the fifth was not proven, the court concluded that he could not be classified as a habitual offender. It found that the initiation of the history sheet had not followed proper procedures and violated the petitioner\u2019s fundamental rights under Article 21.\u201cIt also appears that the history sheet of the petitioner has been opened not in accordance with the relevant police rules and the opening of the history sheet against the petitioner offends his fundamental right enshrined in Article 21 of the constitution of India,\u201d the bench maintained.As a result, the court granted the petition and ordered the removal of the history sheet opened against the petitioner.Case Title: Bashir-Ud-Din Vs UT Of J&K", "Delhi High Court Upholds Student Rights Over University Ordinances": "LI NetworkPublished on: 26 September 2023 at 12:40 ISTIn a significant ruling, the Delhi High Court has emphasized that university ordinances for self-regulation should not infringe upon a student\u2019s fundamental rights to education and human dignity. Justice Purushaindra Kumar Kaurav made this observation while hearing a case involving two students seeking inter-college migration within colleges affiliated with Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University.One of the students pursuing a BBA degree at Maharaja Surajmal Institute of Technology sought the transfer on the grounds that her college was more than 30 kilometers away from her residence, and she suffered from allergies triggered by dust, animal dander, or pollen. The other student, studying at Agrasen Institute of Management Studies, agreed to the interchange to accommodate the former.Their grievance stemmed from a notification issued by the university in July of the previous year, amending Ordinance 7, which governed student migration. The amendment imposed a complete ban on intra and inter-university migration.Justice Kaurav acknowledged that the ban on migration appeared to be based on recommendations from the university\u2019s expert committee and did not seem arbitrary or illegal on its face. However, he noted that exceptions should be made, particularly in cases of medical emergencies, and that a more flexible approach should be adopted.The court stressed that universities, with their statutory discretion, could establish general rules and principles for guidance in extraordinary circumstances. It emphasized that universities should not be inflexible when students provide compelling reasons for seeking migration.Furthermore, the court asserted that students have the right to quality higher education and that depriving them of this right due to medical conditions beyond their control would be detrimental to the country\u2019s future. It emphasized that university ordinances for self-regulation should not override a student\u2019s right to education and human dignity.The court called upon universities to consider the extraordinary circumstances of students and evaluate their applications with fairness and reasonableness. It cautioned that the exercise of discretionary power should not be marred by unreasonableness or arbitrariness.Justice Kaurav directed the Vice Chancellor of GGSIPU to render a decision within six weeks. The court advised that the Vice Chancellor should base the decision on the merits of the students\u2019 grievances, independent of the previous year\u2019s notification.", "J&K High Court: Article 226 Authority is Beyond Administrative Actions to Promissory Estoppel": "LI NetworkPublished on: 26 September 2023 at 12:35 ISTThe Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court has reaffirmed the expansive reach of Article 226 of the Constitution, emphasizing that it is not limited to reviewing administrative and executive decisions but extends to overseeing the application of the doctrine of promissory estoppel.Justice Wasim Sadiq Nargal underscored that Article 226 empowers the High Court to ensure that the government honors its commitments.\u201cThe jurisdiction of the High Court while exercising the powers under Article 226 of the Constitution of India is not restricted only to the review of the administrative actions and executive decisions of the State but also extends to the applicability of the \u2018doctrine of promissory estoppels\u2019 of which the whole object is to see that the Government sticks to its promise and abides by it.\u201dThis assertion came in response to a petition filed by a consortium of hotel and guesthouse owners who had encountered financial hardships due to the government\u2019s failure to fulfill promises made under a special tourism revival scheme.The petitioners argued that their establishments were properly registered and that the hotel industry, particularly in the Kashmir Valley, had suffered greatly since 1990. In an effort to rejuvenate tourism in the region, the Union Government had approved a special package in 2003. This package included soft loans for the renovation and refurbishment of hotels.However, despite the allocation of funds by the Centre for the interest subsidy, the money was diverted to other purposes, leaving the hotel owners in dire financial straits.Consequently, the petitioners sought the release of the promised interest subsidies and implored the court to halt any recovery actions by lending banks. They contended that this violated the principles of promissory estoppel, which dictate that when one party makes a clear promise intended to create legal obligations, and the other party relies on that promise to their detriment, the promising party cannot backtrack on the commitment.In response, the government conceded that they had not disbursed the full interest subsidy as outlined in the scheme due to a shortage of funds. Nevertheless, they did not contest the petitioners\u2019 entitlement to the subsidy.Justice Nargal stressed that the doctrine of promissory estoppel applies to government actions, whether in its sovereign or business capacities. The court emphasized that when the government makes a definite promise with the intent that it be acted upon, and the promisee acts accordingly, altering their position, the government is bound by that commitment.Referring to the precedent set in Union of India and Ors. v. Godfrey Philips India Ltd (1985), the bench asserted that the government cannot evade its obligations by invoking the doctrine of executive necessity or freedom of future executive action.The bench also invoked Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills Co. (P) Ltd. Vs. State of U.P and Ors and reiterated that no distinction can be drawn between the exercise of a sovereign function and a trading or business activity of the Government.\u201cWhatever be the nature of the function which the Government is discharging, the Government is subject to the rule of promissory estoppel, and if the essential ingredients of this rule are satisfied, the Government can be compelled to carry out the promise made by it.\u201dConsequently, the court concluded that the government\u2019s failure to disburse the interest subsidy in full, despite the hotel owners meeting all eligibility criteria, constituted a breach of the principles of promissory estoppel.In light of this, the court granted the petition and directed the government to release the entire interest subsidy amount to the hotel owners through their respective banks within a period of two months.Case Title: Hotel Ashai Srinagar & Ors.

It noted that the petitioners should not be allowed to bypass the existing and effective statutory remedy available to them under Section 397 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC).Justice Saurabh Banerjee stated, \u201cIt is trite law that a Court while interpreting a provision of the Statute is bound to abide by what is expressed and contained therein without interfering or altering or carving out either a new meaning or something which is not manifest therefrom. As per the facts of the present case, admittedly, when an appropriate and specific remedy of law under the (same) Statute being the CrPC is already available to the Petitioners, this Court in view of the aforesaid conclusion and even otherwise as per the legal position finds no reason to interfere with the impugned order passed by the learned Trial Court.\u201dThe State argued that the petition was not maintainable under Section 482 of the CrPC, as an alternative and effective remedy of filing a revision under Sections 399, 400, read with Section 397 of the CrPC was available to the petitioners.The Court underlined that Section 482 of the CrPC should be sparingly used and only when the petitioners can demonstrate to the Court\u2019s satisfaction that it is necessary. Furthermore, the Court noted that there was no clear indication in the petition suggesting that this was an exceptional case warranting the Court\u2019s interference under Section 482 of the CrPC.The Court stated, \u201cAccordingly, and even otherwise, after finding that there is no pleading to the effect that the case of the petitioners is such that this Court can exercise its inherent powers for interfering under Section 482 of the CrPC, which undisputedly is to be exercised sparingly, this Court is constrained to hold that the instant petition in the present form is not maintainable in the eyes of the law or under the facts involved. In view thereof, this Court is hesitant to enter into the domain of the disputes involved herein under the present petition filed under the provisions of Section 482 Cr.P.C.\u201dGiven the lack of a valid argument supporting the use of inherent powers under Section 482 of the CrPC, the Court concluded that the petition was not legally maintainable based on the circumstances of the case.", "Madras High Court Recognizes Mother\u2019s Claim to Deceased Son\u2019s pensionary Benefits": "LI NetworkPublished on: 26 September 2023 at 11:30 ISTThe Madras High Court, Madurai Bench, has affirmed that a mother, as both a senior citizen and a legal heir, is entitled to a portion of her son\u2019s terminal and pensionary benefits.A writ petition was filed, requesting the court to instruct the respondents to release the terminal benefits of the petitioner\u2019s son.Justice L. Victoria Gowri, presiding over a Single Bench, remarked, \u201cThe argument put forth by the learned Special Government Pleader is untenable because the mother/petitioner, as a senior citizen and one of the four legal heirs of the late Subramanian, is entitled to a \u00bc share in all of her son\u2019s terminal and pensionary benefits.\u201dIn this particular case, the petitioner\u2019s son served as a Superintendent in the Ex-Service Welfare Department and passed away while in service. He left behind his mother (the petitioner), his wife, and two minor children. The petitioner claimed that during her son\u2019s lifetime, he and his wife lived separately, and multiple matrimonial cases were pending in various courts.To cover the medical expenses for her son\u2019s liver ailment, the petitioner borrowed money from various individuals, incurring significant costs. After her son\u2019s passing, the petitioner sent a comprehensive representation to the respondents, seeking her share of her son Subramanian\u2019s terminal benefits.

The Court ordered the reversal of the disputed amount in the petitioner\u2019s savings bank account.Justice Kalyan Rai Surana, presiding over a Single Judge Bench, emphasized that the bank must adhere to the explicit terms and conditions when issuing ATM cards. The judgment concluded that the petitioner was a victim of cyber-crime, and the respondents failed to demonstrate that SMS alerts were issued to the petitioner for the disputed transactions.The case involved a petitioner who claimed that an ATM-cum-Debit Card was issued to him by an SBI branch without e-commerce facility. It was alleged that although e-commerce facilities were subsequently provided to the petitioner through a 16-digit ATM-cum-Debit Card, he was not informed or provided with the CVV number. The petitioner argued that without the CVV, e-commerce or online transactions could not be conducted using the ATM-cum-Debit Card. During a short period between May 08, 2012, and May 17, 2012, an amount of Rs. 4,44,699.17 was fraudulently withdrawn from his account through illegal online transactions without any SMS alerts being received. After the petitioner filed complaints with the bank and the CID, a case was registered. The petitioner sought an inquiry into why SMS alerts were not received and the refund of the fraudulently withdrawn amount.The Court found that the 19-digit ATM-cum-debit card was indeed equipped with e-commerce facilities. It further noted that the CID\u2019s investigation traced the origin of the crime to Thane District of Maharashtra, but the suspect\u2019s name and address were found to be fake. The Court observed that there was no scope to verify the truthfulness of the petitioner\u2019s claim regarding SMS alerts, making it difficult to trace the accused. Additionally, the respondents failed to produce records showing that SMS alerts for the alleged fraudulent transactions were generated and sent from their computer system.Consequently, the High Court directed the respondents to deposit the sum of Rs. 4,44,699.17 in the petitioner\u2019s bank account and granted them the liberty to recover the amount from the individuals to whose accounts the money was transferred.Case Title: Jyoti Bezbarua Goswami and Ors. v.
